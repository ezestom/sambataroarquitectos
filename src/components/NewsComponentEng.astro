            "Architect Alfio Sambataro confessed to feeling 'sorrow' for the deterioration of the current facilities in the space located in Güemes, between Roca and San Lorenzo. 'What was lacking here were resources and the necessary planning for maintenance,' he stated. Lack of maintenance. Scarce resources. Deterioration. Abandonment. These are the perceptions that can be noticed at first glance in the Plaza del Agua, a place with an iconic and distinctive category, imposed with solid arguments by its more than 100 years of history. The same benches are still placed in the space located in Güemes, between Roca and San Lorenzo, the same precariousness of the access devices to parking, the same chipped paint on the buildings, and other shortcomings that are visible on the external façade, all evidence illustrating the process of decline that has taken place in recent years. An expert view, such as that of architect Alfio Sambataro, recognizes and notices with some 'surprise' the structural deficiencies that the Plaza del Agua cannot hide, especially in light of the intended tourist use of this iconic place. 'The condition of the facilities of this plaza is somewhat sad because what it shows is abandonment and a lack of maintenance,' said the specialist, who added: 'Surely, what was lacking here were resources and the necessary planning for maintenance.' In this regard, the architect also pointed out to El Marplatense that there is an 'important degree of interventions' on the structure of the space that were made without prioritizing the 'architectural point of view.' 'What has been done is not in line with restoring the building, but rather the opposite,' Sambataro criticized, emphasizing at the same time: 'The restoration of this place is not only about recovering its architecture but also adding functionality.' The deterioration of Plaza del Agua is also tangible through the lack of care exposed by the masonry ornaments, the sheet metal roofs, the carpentry, the ceilings, and the lighting of the place. THE PROJECT AIMING TO LEAVE BEHIND THE 'ABANDONMENT' The public-private initiative aiming to establish a Mixed Cultural Hub over Plaza del Agua includes a comprehensive architectural renovation of the current facilities. The project not only seeks to revalue and protect the place as heritage, but it also aims for the community to fully appreciate its worth, with outstanding productions, specifically creating spaces for expression and training for the entire Mar del Plata community and its visitors. The proposal presented by the Executive to hand over the plaza, which has already received preliminary approval from the Honorable Deliberative Council, intends to create a strategic point that will further boost tourism year-round and allow the community to have a Cultural and Expression Multispace. It envisions the use of media platforms on both national and international levels.",

Regarding the landscape where the stage was set up, Castro joked: 'I was telling Teté, this night, by the sea, with San Martín park and a glorious stage.' On the Teatro Tronador, which will be the first national branch of the prestigious Colón’s Superior Institute of Art, the renowned journalist stated: 'It will allow the study of new careers in Mar del Plata and make many more things like this happen during the season, with two or three of these events in the summer.' Coustarot added, 'We need to support, encourage, and provide the opportunity because talent is everywhere. The orchestra from Chascomús, which performed today, has more than 800 students.' The host also expressed: 'We must thank Espacio Clarín, which has been a great promoter of art throughout the summer.'",

Enrique Arturo Diemecke, General Artistic Director of Teatro Colón and the Philharmonic Orchestra of Buenos Aires, highlighted that a 'fantastic program with Beethoven and Leonard Bernstein's repertoire' will be performed, featuring West Side Story and the Seventh Symphony. The initiative stems from a decision by the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires to federalize its prestigious artistic and cultural offerings across the country, particularly emphasizing Mar del Plata, where this goal was solidified with the establishment of the Superior Institute of Art of the distinguished institution at the Teatro Tronador. Meanwhile, efforts from both the private and public sectors, through national, provincial, and municipal governments, made it possible to create the conditions to bring this plan to fruition, with the essential objective of strengthening the public's interest in high-level art in the country. 'This is a spectacular moment for the Philharmonic Orchestra,' Diemecke said, adding, 'We are very excited to go there, to be in that spectacular space.' He continued, 'I believe that with this concert, we will deliver a wonderful performance so everyone can enjoy the music, nature, and the company of all.' Diemecke emphasized that the Philharmonic 'is going through an excellent moment.'

'I think this is a spectacular moment and we are happy to share it with you,' he said. 'A total of 80 musicians will be traveling. Some instruments will travel by land, others by air,' he added. Furthermore, the conductor mentioned, 'Since it is an outdoor concert, we aim to have music that is more familiar to the public, music that can be immediately recognized by the name of the composer or the work.' According to Arroyo, it is 'the cherry on top' of the season.

Photo: Ministry of Culture of the Province. Maestro Enrique Arturo Diemecke had predicted it, and his prediction came true just minutes after the concert began, when the eighty musicians of the prestigious Buenos Aires Philharmonic Orchestra advanced through the score of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7: 'When people connect with the environment, they start to understand why classical music is called classical, because it connects us with the universe, nature, and everyone in one single environment,' and the setting couldn’t have been more captivating: the closing of Mar del Plata's season with an impressive concert on a warm summer night by the sea. Buenos Aires Philharmonic concert in Mar del Plata. Photos: Christian Heit. The audience is the city's own coast, the General San Martín Park, where one can observe a serene sea like few times before. For the repertoire, the conductor of the orchestra, which usually performs at Teatro Colón, included works that might be more familiar to an audience not very familiar with classical music. And the opening was with the National Anthem, in honor of the 44 missing from the ARA San Juan submarine. People arrived early with chairs and cushions. 'We found out by chance and came. This is unique,' said Gustavo Farías from Floresta, who was with his wife. 'We didn’t want to miss the opportunity, and here we are. It’s magnificent,' agreed Norma, Elena, and María, friends from Mar del Plata. The concert in Mar del Plata. In addition to Beethoven’s symphony, the concert was primarily dedicated to the music of Leonard Bernstein; on April 25, it will be 100 years since the birth of the American composer, pianist, and conductor. The orchestra began its concert series at the Colón with a tribute to Bernstein, and some of those pieces, like the Symphonic Dances from 'West Side Story', were played last night at Playa Grande. This unique experience was supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Province, the Colón and Tronador theaters, and the Wam production company. The concert began in the late Mar del Plata afternoon. Before the Buenos Aires Philharmonic played, the orchestra from a music school in Chascomús performed, but since the morning, San Martín Park had been a magnet for Mar del Plata residents and tourists. The musicians rehearsed while runners passed by, under the honor boxes that the balconies of the surrounding buildings turned into, visible to sailors who anchored their boats to listen from the sea at Playa Grande, and to those who took advantage of a spectacular day at the beach. 'It’s a day to celebrate; today Mar del Plata is happy, and it’s making all its inhabitants and visitors happy,' said Gabriela Magnoler, director of Tourism for the city, just a few meters from the stage. The event was hosted by Teté Coustarot and Nelson Castro, and among the guests was María Victoria Alcaraz, director of the Teatro Colón.",

            "Magdalena Ruiz Guiñazú, Marcelo Bonelli, Adrián Ventura, and Sergio Rubín led a visit on Saturday to the final stage of the complete renovation of the iconic theater located at Santiago del Estero 1746, where the first satellite campus of the Instituto Superior de Arte del Teatro Colón will operate in the coming weeks. Also present were various media representatives from Mar del Plata. Prominent national journalism figures led a visit on Saturday noon to the brand-new facilities of the Teatro Tronador, which is in the final stage of a complete renovation that will make it the main protagonist of a historic event: in the coming weeks, it will become the first satellite campus of the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) of the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. Figures such as Magdalena Ruiz Guiñazú, Adrián Ventura, Marcelo Bonelli, and Sergio Rubín visited the venue at Santiago del Estero 1746, where they all highlighted the significant cultural impact of the prestigious institute's arrival in 'La Feliz.' 'Truly impressive. Everything related to the transmission of culture is fundamental in every country for its citizens. What is happening in Mar del Plata is of enormous importance for the entire country,' insisted the renowned announcer and writer to El Marplatense. During the tour, Ruiz Guiñazú confessed that she had never been in 'a construction like this' and trusted that its final result would be 'magnificent.' 'Argentinians evidently have a vocation for effort, beauty, and culture, and that is what will be gathered in this theater,' she considered. As the first satellite campus of the Teatro Colón outside Buenos Aires since its inauguration in 1908, the journalist also emphasized 'the significant decentralization' this action represents. 'I am not the only one; I think there are many people eager to see the completed work, so it will be a pleasure to return and attend a performance,' she assured. 'It’s truly a fantastic project. It will change the quality of Mar del Plata in terms of theater offerings, which are excellent, but infrastructure matters too. It will allow the creation of quality works of a certain caliber that can only be seen at Teatro Colón. For Argentina and the city, it’s excellent,' pointed out Marcelo Bonelli when asked by the media. In this context, the journalist from Todo Noticias and Radio Mitre considered it 'a turning point' that 'opens up an entire expectation and generation of hope,' since 'carrying out these kinds of projects fills one with pride because culture and theater add quality of life to society.' 'I wish such works could be carried out in all cities of Argentina. The most important thing is the possibility of having a theater school, where young people can be awarded scholarships, which promotes culture and social equality,' he expressed. In the same vein, writer and biographer Sergio Rubín highlighted the work at the Teatro Tronador as 'a clear commitment to culture.' 'It’s very important because it allows people who lack resources or who are far from major urban centers to access culture,' he explained, adding, 'How much we Argentinians need to deepen our education. That’s what really matters in the long run. The economy comes and goes, but what really remains and boosts everything else is the development of culture.' The journalist expressed being 'pleasantly surprised' by the initiative and said he thought it was 'fantastic.' 'I was surprised by this project because of the volume of the investment, the production, and the attention to every detail,' he argued. 'This is the first time in 160 years that Teatro Colón has expanded to another part of the country, so this is a tremendous opportunity. One truly sees things like this in Argentina and feels hope, especially with all the complicated situations we face,' he added, concluding, 'We’re not discovering anything new, but it adds something of immense quality and level to Mar del Plata, which is fantastic for La Feliz.' During the tour, media figures from Mar del Plata, such as Gabriela Azcoitia, Daniel Ramos, and Esteban Salinas (Channel 8), Germán Lagrasta, Mariana Gérez, Florencia Palmieri, and Martín Dantas (Channel 10), Hernán Gaspari (Radio Mitre Mar del Plata), among other recognized colleagues, also attended. Since early February, the Teatro Tronador has welcomed high-profile figures, such as Paloma Herrera and Iñaki Urlezaga, two of the leading figures in national ballet. Subsequently, the facilities were also visited by renowned journalists Alfredo Leuco and Nelsón Castro. The new venue at Santiago del Estero 1746 will have a capacity to accommodate up to 900 spectators. In the coming weeks, state-of-the-art equipment will be imported from abroad. The Instituto Superior de Arte del Teatro Colón (ISATC) was created under that name in 1960. It currently offers programs in Dance, Singing, Orchestral Academy, Opera Stage Direction, Opera Musical Preparation, and Characterization. The arrival of ISA to Mar del Plata is a historic event, as it marks the first time Teatro Colón expands its classes beyond Buenos Aires. The agreement to open the first satellite campus of the Colón School outside of Buenos Aires was signed on September 14 at the Golden Hall of Teatro Colón. The signing of the mutual collaboration agreement between the city and the province of Buenos Aires was attended by Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, Mayor of Buenos Aires; María Eugenia Vidal, Governor of Buenos Aires Province; Ángel Mahler, Minister of Culture of Buenos Aires City; Alejandro Gómez, Minister of Culture of Buenos Aires Province; and Marcelo González, promoter and owner of the Teatro Tronador in Mar del Plata, where the initiative will take shape. The decision to open a satellite campus in Buenos Aires Province is driven by the large number of students from the region. This project is part of the City of Buenos Aires Government’s goal to take Teatro Colón beyond its historic building and reach audiences across the country through initiatives like the 'Colón Federal' program, which is bringing Colón performances to various locations around Argentina.",

            'The venue that hosted Olmedo, Porcel, and Susana Giménez is being remodeled. A school from the Teatro Colón will operate there. Reaching the door of the iconic and old Tronador Theatre in Mar del Plata takes us back to the theatrical performances where Mariano Mores, Alberto Olmedo, Jorge Porcel, Moria Casán, and Susana Giménez shone during their golden years. Images of illuminated marquees and packed halls come to mind, showcasing hits that marked Argentine popular culture over the last 40 years. At the door, one can feel the nostalgia and the hope of returning to those magical times when the theater was a sacred treasure, an incorruptible local icon. The hall closed its doors in 2015, and the remodeling process began early last year. With construction helmets on, politicians and celebrities toured the facilities of what will be the new Tronador Theatre, a complex of over 3,000 square meters, managed by businessman and artistic producer Marcelo González (the current owner), along with two architects, Mar del Plata native Mariano Englebienne and Alfio Sambataro from the Teatro Colón, and scenic designer Enrique Bordolini.

At the main entrance, the escalators that connect the street to the foyer of the new Tronador Complex are visible, where the first branch of the Instituto Superior de Arte del Teatro Colón will also function. “The foyer floors will be made of Italian marble in black and white,” said the architects. On the first level, there will be the box office, café, cloakroom, and public restrooms. Render of how the Tronador Theatre will look once the work is completed. From there, visitors will access the Escuela Superior de Arte del Colón, where the official dance program will be taught. The two halls are being renovated and feature Harlequin-imported floors, specially designed for ballet, as well as acoustic isolation systems. Moving to the next level, the central theater hall awaited the 60 workers who are making this project possible. Amid applause from the artists and a massive stage under construction, the General Director of Teatro Colón, María Victoria Alcaraz, praised the hardworking team’s efforts to bring the project to life with acoustics worthy of the Colón and superb visibility from every angle of the hall. Tour of the Tronador Theatre. “The stage (18x14 meters) is detachable and was designed piece by piece by specialized turners. It also features automated bars imported from Germany and a state-of-the-art motorized curtain,” explained one of the architects. During her speech, Alcaraz said: “Today, this is no longer a dream but a reality. Mar del Plata is a beautiful city with a lot of talent. Many people choose it to vacation, but also to see new performances.” Throughout the year, ballet dancers, orchestras, and opera singers from Teatro Colón will perform on the stage, making the acoustics a high-complexity challenge. “The goal was to make the stage adaptable to the various artistic performances the theater will host once it opens. Acoustic engineer Jorge Sommerhoff decided to cover the entire hall with wood to maintain a level of sound perfection like that of the Colón,” they explained. The hall will feature 790 blue leather seats facing the stage. To improve sightlines, “the hall’s levels were redesigned.” On the second level, there will be eight boxes, each accommodating between 8 and 11 people. They will have preferential parking services (two or three for each) and personalized bar service. Tour of the Tronador Theatre. The ceiling of the hall was demolished and rebuilt with over 170 tons of iron to support the aerial walkways that will cross the hall from side to side for 360° guided tours that will review the place’s mystique and history. The entire complex will be equipped with a special soundproofing system. “The ceilings and walls were covered in wood without the need for electronic sound amplification,” they clarified. María Victoria Alcaraz, General Director of Teatro Colón. In an interview with Clarín, the new owner of the Tronador emphasized the need to revalue culture and recalled that in recent years, many theaters in Mar del Plata have closed. “Without access to culture, no country can grow and evolve. We are proud to carry out the renovation of a theater that had been abandoned. It’s a cultural milestone for Mar del Plata and its surroundings because without culture, there is no future,” he assured.',

            "The jury of the competition organized by the ARQ magazine and the Central Society of Architects highlighted an urban completion in La Plata, a media library in CABA, and a production center in Tigre. Two towers and a group of low-rise buildings enhance the access to the city of La Plata, according to one of the winning proposals of the Clarín-SCA Award for students. Once again, the National Clarín-SCA Awards for architecture students were awarded. With this latest edition held yesterday at the auditorium of the Central Society of Architects, there have been 17 editions. The award originated in a section of the ARQ-Clarín magazine called El Taller, which is the space for architectural faculties where students practice producing all kinds of projects, from small domestic scale to urban ones. The purpose of this section and the award was initially to recognize the work of students and teachers. It serves as a starting point for future architects to forge their own professional careers. Over the years, this has been validated. Students who passed through El Taller later played significant roles in major works, such as Andrés Schulman, the first published in El Taller in 1991, who later worked on the restoration and technological modernization of the Teatro Colón; Rosario-born Alejandro Beltramone, who redesigned the surroundings of the Monument to the Flag; Carla Bechelli, an associate of Rafael Viñoly in projects like Carrasco Airport or the Acqua apartments in Punta del Este; Gastón Paulo Flores, the author of the Metropolitan Design Center and the new headquarters of the Professional Council of Architecture and Urbanism; Sergio Ronzoni, supervising the works of the Usina del Arte. Or more recently, Ludmila Crippa, who won several awards in Housing Competitions for Villa Olímpica in Comuna 8, and Agostina Sambataro, who worked on the functional and technological updates of the Coliseum Theater, among many other prominent students. The award has also served year after year as a snapshot of architecture education in the country and to see which topics are of concern or focus for university professors in their workshops. For this edition, the large thematic spectrum presented, the jury composed of architects Emilio Rivoira (voted by the participants), Fernando Jaime (by ARQ-Clarín), Matías Gigli (by SCA), and Mario Boscoboinik (by FADEA), selected three projects that show different disciplinary fields. One addresses a major urban issue with residential buildings that fit into the neighboring fabric, combined with two towers serving as entry portals to the city of La Plata. The second is the most “architectural” in the traditional sense. It proposes the design of a single building to house a media library on a plot of land that was once a parking lot at Av. Córdoba and Rodríguez Peña. And the third attempts to provide multiple environmental, energy, and social responses for a Training and Production Center in the flood-prone areas of Tigre. The winners of the Clarín SCA Award 2017. Photo: Mario Quinteros. Let's take a closer look at each one. Alex Iván Andino and Carolina Rouaux, from the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the National University of La Plata, propose creating an access portal to the city of Diagonals with two residential towers. For this, in this academic exercise, they propose for the area bounded by streets 115, Av. 1, and streets 2, 33, and 34, to bury the train, with the aim of turning Av. 1 into a major circulation route. A portal for La Plata, one of the winning works. “In this way, the heavy traffic would be divided between Av. 122 (the continuation of R.N. 11) and the new section of the Buenos Aires - La Plata Highway. Thus, Av. 1 would recover its identity, which had been lost due to the presence of the railroad tracks, and mainly, it would be given the necessary prominence to position it as the main access route to the city.” In addition to the two residential towers, they propose other low-rise buildings in the form of strips with ground floors and 2 to 9 stories with large interior patios that complete, reshape, and organize the three blocks from which the towers emerge. The students from La Plata propose combining towers with lower residential strips that blend with the existing landscape. They also launch a proposal for housing units, saying: “Today's inhabitants (thinking about the challenge of designing housing for the next 50 years) need flexible spaces in their use, unstable, capable of conceiving overlapping uses. We understand that the new home is, in fact, many things: it stretches, compresses, adapts, and changes.” To provide an answer, they designed a system that allows for changes over time. The housing units designed by the students can adjust to the needs of different types of families. Nicolás Ricci (FADU-UBA) was tasked with designing a highly institutional building, which in the exercise was called Mediateca de Buenos Aires, something like the contemporary and scaled version of the National Library in the City. What an incredible commission, especially with the precedent of Clorindo Testa’s library! The media library designed by Nicolás Ricci from FADU has a great institutional presence. The plot, with fronts on Av. Córdoba, Rodríguez Peña street, and Petronila Rodríguez square, is highly coveted. And it cries out for a good building. The media library faces Av. Córdoba and expands over Petronila Rodríguez square with an outdoor auditorium. Ricci did not miss the opportunity and proposed a large metal cube, strategically perforated, to create a play of masses, full and empty, addressing both the orientation and the building's functions: On the corner facing Av. Córdoba, he created a large institutional-scale entrance, and another one as an extension over the square where he placed bleachers, creating a sort of public outdoor amphitheater. The other winning project belongs to Nicolás Matteassi and Juan Gómez from the Faculty of Architecture, Design, Art, and Urbanism at the University of Morón. It emphasizes sustainability, a subject to which the recently deceased Dean of the Morón Faculty, Oscar Borrachia, paid special attention. A forest of buildings was proposed by the students of Morón for a training and production center in Tigre. And it's no wonder. We all know that the health of the habitat and the planet are in trouble. Architects are part of what is happening. As Norman Foster, the English architect behind our government headquarters, once said, “75% of the energy produced on the planet is consumed by 25% of the global population; and the most alarming thing is that half of it is consumed by buildings.” The project attempts to adapt to the site and take its lessons. The Morón students proposed circular buildings made of laminated wood for a Training and Production Center in flood-prone areas of Tigre, aimed at the island inhabitants. The buildings’ shape alludes to tree trunks: the trunk anchors to the ground and supports the canopy, where classrooms, workshops, product exhibition areas, administration, and services are located… Additionally, there is a section called Usina where energy is produced for the building's operation. There, waste is treated, rainwater is collected and treated for reuse in irrigation, and is purified for hygiene and consumption. The Training and Production Center is located by the river and in a flood-prone area, which is why it adopts the trunk-canopy shape. The complex also has an adjustable system with grilles for controlling lighting, temperature, and ventilation. It also features solar panels on the roofs that rise and rotate to follow the sun's trajectory.",

            "During the 2016/17 recess, the authorities of the Teatro Coliseo completed a new stage of the ambitious project for the enhancement, remodeling, equipping and modernization of the building facilities. Initiated in 2013, this initiative by Elisabetta Riva - general director of the theater - began with an in-depth survey and diagnosis study that allowed the design of a comprehensive project covering not only its stage box but also the entire building infrastructure, both in its aspects of technical functionality and in terms of aesthetics and heritage conservation. The recovery plan for a traditional and valuable cultural space for the city demanded significant economic and time resources, considering that the Theater authorities established as one of the priorities to carry it out without interrupting the activity of the Coliseo in any period. The project was able to be completed by developing a multidisciplinary project, which contemplated a careful establishment of the different stages of execution, its correlation with the programming of each season on the one hand and with the valuable contribution of the CABA Patronage Law. Thus, the new Coliseo recovers its original architectural imprint and incorporates the most modern technology in stage equipment in the country. FRONT. The complete repair of the theater's facade respected the original architecture, with 1,250 m2 of frontage. Facade restoration Within this framework, the complete repair of the facade was carried out, respecting the original architecture of the 1,250 m2 of frontage. The building conservation operations were carried out, which included registration and documentation, cleaning, consolidation, metal stabilization, correction of misadjustments, reintegration of missing parts and renovation of systems that have reached the end of their useful life. The objective sought with this intervention was to preserve the physical testimony, recovering its original visual reading, but respecting the noble aging details of the materials. Thus, the recovery of all original materials and devices in conditions to be preserved was adopted as a general principle. The search for authenticity in the intervention required distinguishing between the original parts and replacement elements so as not to make a historical fake on a building considered a testimony of an era. MODULAR. The new concert chamber, manufactured in the country, is dismountable and has a renovated lighting system. The diagnosis concluded that the general state of conservation of the envelope was good, with the most serious deteriorations being those caused by previous interventions, lack of maintenance and obsolescence of some construction systems. Fortunately, most of the constituent elements were recoverable and were preserved in their original position. The current intervention was harmoniously integrated into the building and respected the original balance of solids and voids. Interior design After a detailed study of the color palette and tone gradients - using virtual models - the room was painted, in order to favor the atmosphere before and during the show. The surface finishes of the room were recovered, respecting the original environment and sectors that had been intervened in recent years and did not favor its functionality were restored. MATERIALITY. Both the walls and the ceiling are resistant aluminum structures, covered with wood. Regarding lighting, the original ceilings that generate the ambient light of the room were recovered, which were fully adapted to current regulations. Warm LED light was added to the perimeter throats of the back walls of each level, highlighting the curved geometry of the edge and highlighting the texture of the wood. Stage floor For the design of the new stage floor, a criterion of maximum flexibility of geometric transformation was adopted which, preserving the resistance characteristics typical of theatrical use, makes it a true multifunctional system unique in our country. The remodeled area covered both the stage and the chapel and the rear accesses that connect with the new piano depots and both accesses to the exterior. The work carried out consisted of completely replacing the old and deteriorated existing wooden structure that supported the stage floor, with a completely new system, designed with a functional criterion of maximum flexibility of use in terms of its possible geometric configurations of openings and traps. VOLUMETRY. The plan of the acoustic chamber has the typical trapezoidal geometry: a straight back wall and two inclined walls, plus an upper ceiling. The floor of the under-stage level was completely replaced by a reinforced concrete slab with a polished surface finish that, thanks to the free light between three-meter columns, allows maximum use of the surface, both for the movement of technicians and artists, and for the storage of trunks, medium-sized musical instruments, chairs and music stands. The entire set was prepared for the execution of the installation of the automated platform system for the orchestra pit that will be carried out in the next stage. This provides for dividing the 120 m2 surface into two transverse platforms driven by helical-type electric actuators that will allow multiple configurations, ranging from the extension of the proscenium and stage surface by introducing it into the room, to the regulation of different volumes of the orchestra pit according to the requirements of the show. LONGITUDINAL SECTION. Concert chamber A dismountable modular concert chamber was designed and manufactured in the country, which made it possible to significantly improve the acoustics of the room, incorporating a new lighting system that allows modifying the atmosphere according to the type of concert. TRANSVERSE SECTION. The plan of the new acoustic chamber has the typical trapezoidal geometry. A straight back wall, two inclined side walls and an upper ceiling as a closure of the horn. Both its side walls and its ceiling are materialized in resistant aluminum structures covered with layers of natural-colored polished wood, adopting different curvatures to optimize the distribution of sound towards the room according to the acoustic design. In turn, they have a device that allows regulating the inclination and its position of incidence with respect to the horizontal and vertical plane for finer adjustment. There was also a set of interventions in the electrical and cold-heat supply installations, as well as in pipes, ducts and technical support areas. In the artistic depots, work was done based on temperature and humidity control criteria. The last works will begin soon: the remodeling of the second-floor dressing rooms, the full recovery of the Vittorio Gassman rehearsal room and the construction of a new orchestra pit with automated platforms.

            "Elisabetta Riva, a prominent Italian actress, producer, and graduate in Letters, led the monumental task of the architectural and artistic remodeling of the Teatro Coliseo, which today stands as a rationalist jewel in Buenos Aires. How did the project come about? Riva was invited by the Italian Embassy to be part of the Council of the Cultural Coliseum Foundation, which manages the theater. From the beginning, she considered that to improve both the quality and quantity of the artistic offerings, a renovation was essential. With the support of the Patronage Law and the diagnosis of architect Alfio Sambataro, the stages of the project were established. For the facade, inspired by photos from the past, together with Giuseppe Caruso, it was decided to return to the aesthetics of the 60s, the time of the theater's inauguration. Are you satisfied with the current programming? Nuova Harmonia, a theater's own production with 30 years of experience and 1000 subscribers, has managed to maintain its audience while expanding to new content, incorporating ballet, opera, jazz, and rock, in addition to associations with producers. The theater, with its neutral lines, adapts to the shows and its audience. Regarding the sensory experience, Riva modified the lighting during concerts, lowering the lights in the hall to give greater prominence to the artist. In addition, the theater offers a gastronomic intermezzo during the intermission. What place does a theater occupy today? Although screens allow for greater dissemination of content, Riva does not see them as competitors, but as a promotional tool. However, she emphasizes that the event itself must happen live, valuing the exceptionality of the live show, as well as everything that happens around it, including the social aspect.

    //         'De un escenario a otro. La potente ópera de Ligeti está basada en la pieza de teatro “La balada del gran macabro”, del dramaturgo belga Michel de Ghelderode. Bauer hace un balance de las instituciones. "El tango es como la soja”, es el primero de los títulos que suelta Martín Bauer, actual director del Teatro Argentino de La Plata apenas empieza a conversar con Ñ. “Me gustaría que quede bien claro que no tengo nada en contra de la soja ni del tango. Sin embargo, apunto a que el dinero de Cultura se invierta en asuntos que estén menos a la mano de todos nosotros. Tal vez se entienda mejor si continúo con la metáfora sojera: vivamos de la soja, pero intentemos crear productos manufacturados y, sobre todo, sepamos que si solo plantamos soja, la riqueza de nuestra tierra se agotará y nos quedaremos sin nada”. La explicación de Bauer viene a cuento del estreno de El gran macabro, la ópera de György Ligeti, una de las pocas escritas en la segunda parte del siglo pasado (su primera versión es de 1975), que logró atravesar la usual barrera conservadora de las casas de ópera para empezar, poco a poco, a formar parte del repertorio. La ópera tuvo un estreno literalmente rengo, en la apertura de la temporada 2011 del Colón, cuando a pesar de las durísimas medidas de fuerza, Baldur Brönnimann, director musical en esa oportunidad, se decidió a continuar con la empresa porque creía que tenía sentido no tirar por la borda lo realizado por los otros cuerpos artísticos, y permitir que se viera la puesta de la Fura dels Baus. La obra se estrenó con un arreglo para teclados y percusión hecho por el mismo Brönnimann. Esta vez, El gran macabro contará con la puesta en escena de Pablo Maritano, escenografía de Enrique Bordolini y dirección musical del italiano Tito Ceccherini. Ese comienzo fallido no amilana a Bauer. “El proyecto de estrenar El gran macabro en el Argentino surgió a partir del éxito que significó la puesta de Die Soldaten, la ópera que se montó el año pasado en el Colón”, cuenta. La posibilidad de estrenar un título como Die Soldaten, la ópera de Bernd Alois Zimmermann, en un teatro que no cuenta con actualización escenotécnica necesaria para emprender grandes desafíos, desató enormes resistencias: una obra que es descartada por imposible en muchos teatros no podía programarse en el Colón. Contra viento y marea, Darío Lopérfido –quien en ese momento ocupaba el cargo de director artístico del teatro— no solo dio su aprobación para que se programara sino que puso toda su energía en que ese estreno se llevara a cabo de la mejor manera posible. Dice Bauer: “Es vital conocer la historia, no se puede desconocer la tradición porque el pasado es dinámico. Die Soldaten fue el triunfo de la perseverancia de una comunidad exigente en términos culturales, que se preguntó por qué no se podía hacer una obra como esa aquí”. –Es una obra que se hace muy poco en el mundo. –Ahora se hace más. Pero de cualquier modo eso da igual. Porque, ¿cuál sería el mundo? Hay ciudades que no hacen esto pero hacen otra cosa. La pregunta para mí era por qué negarse a un evento como ese cuando Buenos Aires fue y es eso. –Me sorprende tu idea de “pasado dinámico”, suena a revisionismo. –No, está lejos de eso. Lo que quiero decir es otra cosa. Muchísimos porteños no fueron al Di Tella pero, ¿creés que no están afectados por lo que pasó allí? Del mismo modo que uno estaría afectado por la revista Sur aunque no la hubiera leído. Esto es lo que significa para mí el dinamismo del pasado, el hecho de que ese pasado no se pueda desconocer. La existencia de un teatro de ópera funcionando importa no sólo a los trabajadores, la comunidad artística o el público que asiste. Importa también al que no va, pero sobre todo al que podría ir. –Buenos Aires no sería la misma sin la tradición del Colón. Pero también es cierto que el Colón no sería el mismo sin ciertos momentos que lo marcaron como un teatro que estaba mirando lo que pasaba en el mundo. El estreno de Moisés y Aarón, de Schoenberg, en 1970, por ejemplo. –Claro, porque no es el espacio físico lo que determina que un sitio como el Colón sea imprescindible sino lo que suceda dentro de él. De lo que el Colón programe, dependerá su incidencia en nuestras vidas y en las vidas de nuestros hijos y nietos. Die Soldaten fue la culminación de esto. Me acuerdo perfectamente bien del día del estreno en el Gran Abono. Estaba muy perturbado, no tenía una percepción de lo que sucedía en la platea, cosa que no es habitual para mí, que suelo percibir el ánimo del público. Cuando llegó el intervalo, un crítico me levantó el pulgar y recién ahí me relajé un poco. Uno nunca tiene comprado el éxito de una producción. Más allá de todo lo que sucedió en torno a la posibilidad de hacer semejante obra en el Colón, con todo el debate que se desató en aquel momento, fue un hito. Lo que hay que saber es que cuando se produce un hito también se genera una gran ambivalencia. –A esta altura me resulta evidente que estás viendo a El gran macabro como una experiencia en escala La Plata de lo que sucedió con Die Soldaten en Buenos Aires. –Sí. Por eso elegí el mismo equipo artístico. Pero hay cosas para decir: lo primero es que El gran macabro es de las pocas óperas del siglo XX que quedan sin estrenar acá. Te diría que Die Soldaten era un déficit, como también lo era la Cuarta sinfonía de Charles Ives, hasta que la estrenamos en 2012. Porque las cosas hay que decirlas: ¿te imaginás al teatro porteño sin haber estrenado a Harold Pinter? ¿Puede una ciudad que se dice a sí misma capital cultural no estrenar a Harold Pinter? No puede. Del mismo modo, no podía no haberse estrenado la 4ta de Ives aunque fueran a escucharla –y ahora vuelvo al público pero del lado opuesto– solo 100 personas. El público de esa obra existe. Las minorías estéticas existen, y te guste o no, muchas veces lideran. No se puede tachar y subestimar todo eso. Entonces, entre las óperas que faltan del siglo XX, más allá de San Francisco de Asís, si se estrena Ligeti se cubre todo el espectro. –¿Por qué desechás San Francisco de Asís? –Es larga y muy compleja. –Al igual que Die Soldaten. –Pero tiene dos actos, uno igual al otro. Es muy pero muy difícil. Aunque tal vez alguna vez se pueda hacer. –El gran macabro tuvo su estreno fallido. ¿Te parece que cumplió con tu idea de sentar un precedente cultural o no sirvió para mucho? –En su momento no estuve de acuerdo con que se hiciera sin la orquesta, pero retrospectivamente, el hecho de que Baldur tomara esa decisión me hizo pensar en esa voluntad de un grupo humano concentrado en su trabajo, pensando cómo seguir mirando hacia adelante y no para atrás. Se hizo como se pudo. Y yo creo que no hay frustración que dure cien años. Se estrenará ahora completa, con las dificultades que tiene estrenar una ópera como esa, en un contexto tan débil como el del Argentino y de la Argentina. Hay momentos en los que se avanza y momentos en que se retrocede. La comunidad cultural le da mucho a la Argentina. Por eso creo que, en términos generales, a los que conocen el terreno se les debe dar la libertad de equivocarse. El contexto cultural se arma con muchas cosas: con Verdi, con Die Soldaten, con Donizetti. Pero uno no puede restarse al debate. Formar parte de un teatro, verlo funcionar bien es conmovedor. En este caso, el plus lo da este contexto, que es muy difícil. Es muy complejo hacer ópera. –El Argentino volvió a ofrecer sus funciones a las 20, cosa que dificulta la llegada de la gente de Buenos Aires. ¿Estás pensando en un teatro que se abastezca del público local? –Para mí, el Argentino de La Plata es como el Covent Garden: no tiene nada que ver con ningún teatro cercano. Y La Plata es una capital mundial de la Cultura, quiero lo mejor para ella. –¿Por qué no hay ninguna oferta gastronómica en el teatro? Es algo que no sucede en ningún teatro del mundo. –En el caso del Argentino hay un conflicto puntual entre la Fundación del teatro y quien era el proveedor de esa oferta. –¿Y por qué tiene que haber un único proveedor? –Este asunto es parte de lo que se está discutiendo. El teatro está en un proceso de reformas importante. También la provincia de Buenos Aires está redefiniendo su relación con los empleados, con pases a planta. Hay conflictos de todo tipo y grandes. Creo que hay que armonizar siempre con las circunstancias porque tampoco se puede reducir lo que el teatro haga al interés de tal o cual persona. –Volver a tener el orgullo de formar parte de un cuerpo que produce un hecho artístico debería ser un objetivo, que no esté reñido con la discusión salarial. En todos los teatros hay problemas, pero en rarísimas oportunidades se sale a hacer una declaración hacia el público. Aquí, involucrar al público mientras se negocia es la norma. –Un teatro puede desaparecer como desaparecieron los trenes. Quizás no tanta gente lamente la pérdida de un teatro como la de los trenes, pero seguro habrá más de uno que sí lo lamentaría. De cualquier modo, lo que debe saberse es que cuando un teatro cierra pierde una esencia que es imposible reconstruir. El Argentino conserva su esencia. Y eso se ve cuando uno ve entrar a los cuerpos artísticos por la parte de atrás. Deseo y trabajo para que eso no se evapore. Tuve la enorme fortuna de trabajar con Kive Staiff. Él tenía esa idea en el horizonte. Me transmitió no solo el amor sino también las herramientas para percibir lo que sucede en el teatro, no solo dentro del escenario sino con el público. Tuve la experiencia con él de lo que puede ser un teatro, y sobre todo de lo que puede no ser un teatro. –Decís que tuviste la experiencia de saber “qué no es un teatro”. ¿Fue en el San Martín? –Sí, cuando se fue Kive. No quiero ser injusto porque quiero mucho a la gente con la que trabajé después. Y no quiero poner nombres porque no se trata de eso. Pero desde la muerte de Kive hasta hoy, nunca me he sentido parte de algo que haya tenido la mística del San Martín. Esa es la diferencia. Está claro que hubo cosas buenas, pero es lo que llamo el sentido de pertenencia. A mí me pasó lo mismo cuando me fui de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires para vivir en La Plata. Ahí entendí lo que era vivir en un lugar donde las instituciones importan. –En La Plata hay algo vibrante, como lo ha tenido París, una idea de comunidad sin estridencias. –Totalmente, la diferencia está en las frecuencias. Y en esa frecuencia no está todo dado, no está todo consumado. Es como un tejido que tiene una dinámica.”',

            'On April 26th, with an artistic performance that intervened the facade, we celebrated the completion of the third stage of the architectural renovations of the Teatro Coliseo. Program In this new stage of the Teatro Coliseo, figures such as the prestigious Stefano Bollani, the opera L’incoronazione di Poppea, the Baryshnikov show (photo), and in March 2018, Gael García Bernal stand out. (Photo: Cedoc) The building works are part of a broader and more comprehensive project of renovation and relaunching of the Theater, which aims to strengthen its role as an important artistic hub in the City of Buenos Aires. This includes improving the offer both qualitatively and quantitatively for the public, producers, and artists. The global project involves the integral remodeling, under a restoration and adaptation perspective of the facilities, thus achieving improvements on several levels: aesthetic-formal, functionality, and safety. The Coliseo Master Plan has been divided into stages that are carried out during the summer recesses, so as not to interrupt the artistic season. Stages one and two were executed and completed respectively during the summer recesses of 2015 and 2016. With the completion of stage three, we have reached 80% of the total project. Each time, less is missing. When in 2012 the then Italian ambassador, Guido La Tella, invited me to be part of the board of directors of the Fundación Cultural Coliseum (manager of the Teatro Coliseo since 1971, by concession of the Italian Embassy), I found a splendid jewel covered in dirt and dust... and broken in some places. It was urgent to restore its shine, health, vitality, to restore it with much love, dedication, and passion. For this, it was necessary to find the economic resources. These projects require a good dose of recklessness, but also courage, dedication, strategy, and a lot of work. These achievements do not happen by magic. The renovation of the Teatro Coliseo has been a long road whose success has been based on the creation of a strong, committed, honest, and passionate team. From the employees and collaborators of the Theater to the technical professionals (Alfio Sambataro, Agostina Sambataro, Sergio Ronzoni, José Luis Fioruccho, Vargas, Rabuffetti and his team, the Techint Group), the authorities of the Foundation (in particular Néstor Pupillo, Giorgio Alliata, Cristiano Rattazzi and Santiago Rosso), and the Italian Embassy (especially Ambassador Teresa Castaldo), as well as all the institutions that contributed. Also to the producers, artists, and public who accompanied us. Synergy, teamwork, transparent management, and above all, passion. For the inauguration event, a classic of Italian music: "Volare". And the resources to make that dream come true? The extraordinary Patronage Law of the City of Buenos Aires. Juan Manuel Beati and Carlos Porroni, as consecutive presidents of the Cultural Promotion Council, collaborated enormously so that the Ministers of Culture, from Lombardi to Mahler, supported our project, in addition to symbolizing the cultural brotherhood between Italy and Argentina. The beginning of a new stage. We are ready to receive the best and most demanding national and international artistic productions. The Theater produces the Nuova Harmonia Cycle, which is offering its XXXI season. Thus, we have reintegrated dance, opera (and soon theater!) as in the best origins of Harmonia. The renowned Italian jazz pianist, Stefano Bollani, playing in jeans and sneakers, performs variations of Gershwin and contemporary tango, and the Orchestra of the Teatro Regio di Torino presents Vivaldi`s The Four Seasons recomposed by contemporary Max Richter. In each concert, we also invite students from schools with their families, conservatory students, and residents of underprivileged neighborhoods for free. The great concerts of the year. We have a very varied and excellent offer, from national music like Gustavo Santaolalla and Fandermole, to internationally renowned figures such as the legendary Baryshnikov, Zucchero, and Gregory Porter, among others. There will also be shows for the whole family during the winter holidays, such as My Little Pony and Paw Patrol, dance with Momix, the VII International Ballet Gala, Ludmila Pagliero, Iñaki Urlezaga, and a cycle of free concerts for primary schools organized by the Artistic Education Directorate of the Ministry of Culture of CABA. Great news for 2018. And, previewing some exclusive news for 2018, we will have visits from internationally renowned figures, such as Gael García Bernal. What drives us to continue providing the highest quality programming. The achievements obtained are only a starting point. The enhancement and lighting of the Theater`s facade is the symbol of the new opening and the dialogue that the Theater wants to establish with its City, to continue building culture, an indispensable nourishment for society.

            'Musically convincing but less so theatrically, despite the undeniable care of director Pablo Mariano, Giulio Cesare starring Franco Fagioli. Buenos Aires, 06/06/2017. The Teatro Colón with Giulio Cesare in Egitto by Händel offered a musically impeccable edition, but a confusing and unappealing staging. Martín Haselbök, in fact, guided the orchestra with wisdom and skill, delivering a first-rate interpretation. Franco Fagioli, the protagonist, reaffirmed his well-deserved place in the current firmament of international countertenors. His range has developed, and now the brilliant high notes are joined by remarkable low notes, emitted with an almost natural voice. As always, his coloraturas and variations were perfect, and he was an engaging actor. A pleasant surprise came from the American soprano Amanda Majeski, a revelation in the role of Cleopatra. With a strong stage presence and powerful acting, she shone for her timbral homogeneity, beautiful color, refined technique, and perfect management of coloraturas and dynamics. The festival of countertenors, four in total, also featured a superb Jake Arditti as Sesto, Flavio Oliver perfect in singing and acting quality as Tolomeo, and another Argentine, Martín Oro, an excellent Nireno with appropriate comic timing. Adriana Mastrángelo was an impeccable Cornelia. With a fascinating and authoritative stage presence, she offered the right quality of interpretation in every vocal intervention. Hernán Iturralde was professional and effective as Achilla, and Mariano Glacic was an appropriate Curio. As for the staging, its creators opted for what turned out to be a repetitive and banal idea: the change of era to an undefined contemporaneity. Pablo Maritanos vision included sexy waiters, caricatured homosexuals, high society shopping in luxurious stores, powerful people of all kinds, overly seductive women, modern soldiers, and burly guards: all the ingredients that already seem to be the trademark of any contemporary setting. Being an opera in closed numbers, Mariano conceived his direction as a series of small theatrical actions disconnected from each other, in the manner of a revue. Whether one likes this aesthetic choice or not, it cannot be denied that there is serious and meticulous work on the actors and that nothing was left to chance, clearly delineating the actions of all those on stage. The set design by Enrique Bordolini is dominated by a large black pyramid complemented by a golden curtain with vertical opening and another red one with horizontal opening. These and the movements of the pyramid on a revolving stage define the different spaces in which the action takes place. The costumes by Sofía Di Nunzio are functional to the setting and stand out for their creativity and details. The choreography by Carlos Trunsky is adequate, and the lighting by Enrique Bordolini is correct.',

            'Julius Caesar in Egypt / Opera by Händel, with Franco Fagioli (Julius Caesar), Amanda Majeski (Cleopatra), Jake Arditti (Sesto), Adriana Mastrángelo (Cornelia), Flavio Oliver (Tolomeo), Hernán Iturralde (Achilla), Mariano Gladic (Curio) and Martín Oro (Nireno) / Stage direction: Pablo Maritano / Scenography and lighting: Enrique Bordolini / Choreography: Carlos Trunsky. Teatro Colón stable orchestra / Musical direction: Martin Haselböck / At the Teatro Colón / Our opinion: very good. An opera that extends for more than four hours and is concentrated on solo singing requires, essentially, good voices. There is no way to sustain a musical show of this nature without singers capable of facing and overcoming the infinite difficulties that Händel abundantly sowed to bring to life all the beauties that overflow this work. In this sense, the eight members of the cast not only technically resolved all the underlying commitments and dangers but also provided fantastic interpretations, some decidedly masterful. But not everything depends on the singers. The other thorny issue to resolve in front of an opera of these characteristics is how to sustain, from the theatrical point of view, an action that advances only in the recitatives to stop in those da capo arias in which there are practically no texts but emotions and whose durations are not precisely brief. In this aspect, Pablo Maritano bet on different solutions and mostly attractive and highly imaginative approaches, although perhaps it was that multi-aesthetic stage, without a univocal idea throughout the entire opera, that led to some scenes not seeming logical or looking convincing. The opera opens, in this staging, with a golden curtain of vertical movement and, immediately, with another red one of horizontal opening. One and the other will appear on countless occasions with the aim of allowing scenographic adjustments behind them while, without stopping the progress, giving rise to singing scenes and choreographic instances, not always sufficiently clear in their symbolism nor always attractive. But the great bet, and very successful, is the central and omnipresent presence of a monumental four-sided pyramid, with certain architecture more typical of some pre-Columbian Mexican culture than Egyptian, marked by platforms, stairs, spaces, nooks, and highly original settings. The pyramid is mounted on the rotating disk of the stage which is used frequently and that mobility allows space changes without continuity solution while, used creatively, gives rise to situations of moving visual beauty, even within the same scene as when Cleopatra, at the end of the second act, at the moment of her greatest despair, leaves her illuminated chamber to be desolate and solitary in the immensity of a dark, gloomy, and distressing pyramid. However, within that well-achieved continuity and parallel to so many full ideas and so many creative solutions, in the multiplicity of costumes, some inexplicable, and certain randomness in the succession of choreographies and theatrical ensemble scenes, forced or even unnecessary moments slip. However, any scenic slip quickly took a back seat to the glory of eight singers, wonderfully directed and supported by an orchestra that sounded impeccable under the command of a full musician like Martin Haselböck. Although expectations were placed on Franco Fagioli and his splendid present - largely satisfied, of course - the one who surprised the most was the American soprano Amanda Majeski, who composed a superb Cleopatra. To an attractive voice in all its extension and a victorious technical capacity to overcome the devilish coloraturas that Händel imposed on her character, she added interpretations and emotional intensities of the highest level and a grace and a superlative performance. Without making distinctions, the entire cast, made up of foreigners and locals on the same level of efficiency and art, was key for this Giulio Cesare in Egitto to remain as the best of the operas that have been seen so far this year at the Colón. Fearful of the baroque, with its otherness and those feared extensions, the theater did not look full. For the beauty of Händels music, for Maritanos good ideas, and above all, for the performances of its singers, this staging of Julius Caesar deserved full houses. By: Pablo Kohan',

            '“I especially want to emphasize the value these distinctions have for us and what they mean as encouragement in our daily work, which is difficult and based on our own drive,” said Pablo Saraví (concertmaster of the Philharmonic) as he received the award given to the Petrus Quartet as the best national chamber group. The event took place in a highly attended and particularly emotional ceremony, where the Argentine Association of Musical Critics presented the awards for the last season on Monday at the Palace of the local Legislature. The winners of the respective categories included Daniel Barenboim and Antonio Pappano, Nelson Goerner and Lang Lang, Marcelo Álvarez and Jonas Kaufmann, as well as the Cappella Istropolitana, the Buenos Aires Philharmonic Orchestra, the National Academy of Santa Cecilia Orchestra, and the Rundfunkchor Berlin. As revelations, special mentions were given to pianist Beatrice Rana, violinist Lisa Batiashvili, and maestro Lionel Bringuier, while Martha Noguera and Enrique Ricci, Mercedes Pomilio and Julio García Canepa were honored for their careers as performers and teachers, respectively, and Francisco Kröpfl in the composer category. The encouragement award was given to soprano María Goso, pianists Natasha Binder, Gastón Frydman, and Szymon Nehring, the La Plata Sextet, and the Ibero-American Early Music Festival of the San Ignacio Parish. Positive and negative events Regarding the premiered works, the award was given to the opera “Die Soldaten” by Bernd Alois Zimmermann, also chosen as the best production of the season (Marco Funari, Enrique Bordolini, Sofia Di Nunzio, and Pablo Maritano). As for negative events, the critics mentioned “the persistent use of the Colón Theater for shows unrelated to its specific purpose,” while positive events included the commemoration of the centenary of Alberto Ginasteras birth, the complete series of Mahlers Symphonies by the Rosario Provincial Symphony Orchestra, the Colón en Familia and Clásica Joven cycles, the thirty years of Nuova Harmonia, and the inauguration of the Bicentennial Theater of San Juan. Among many other figures present at the ceremony were the director of the Coliseo Theater, Elisabetta Riva, Mario Zaguirre, Secretary of Infrastructure and Cultural Heritage of San Juan (representing his province), the Cultural Attaché of the Polish Embassy, Gregor Sovochinsky, the Director of Studies of the Colón, Eduviges Piccone, soprano Ana María González, and critic Carlos Manso (appointed honorary member), who cited among his teachers Napoleón Cabrera and Albino Diéguez Videla, for so many years Editor of Entertainment at “La Prensa.” “In these times of populism that threatens all aspects of our lives,” it was also said, quoting Konrad Paul Liessman at the opening of the last Salzburg Festivals, “a society believes it is successful based on economic utility and employment. But that society will actually be poor if it has lost contact with the muses, who, bypassing everything else, are the only ones capable of leading us on the paths of art and beauty.”',

            '"For an Opera that is described as dark, intense and ruthless and its plot is filled with murder, betrayal, insanity and death, at its end it might become even more tragic, as expected, but in Gaetano Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor the journey through all that has many beautiful and captivating moments, especially in this revival of the Israeli Operas 2012 production, originally directed by Emilio Sagi while the revival director is Javier Ulacia. The story takes place in the Lowlands of Scotland in the 16th century and tells about Enrico Ashton who in his search of a way to forge an alliance with the new ruling party of Scotlands throne uses his sister Lucia, who is still emotionally fragile due to their mothers recent death, and manipulates her into a diplomatic marriage while deceiving her with forged letters from Edgardo, her love who emigrated to France after they exchanged rings as tokens of their fidelity. Enrico does this with the help of Normano, his accomplice, in order to weaken Lucias resistance for such an arrangement. All the while Lucia is advised by her handmaid, Alisa, and is being pressed towards the marriage by the pastor, Raimondo. As Edgardo appears at her wedding ceremony in which she resistantly marries Arturo, he curses her for her betrayal which leads Lucia to insanity, one that later becomes even greater after she murders her husband. With a nearly full house at Tel Avivs Opera House, the Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center, an extraordinary chorus, the original productions set, costumes and lights, if it werent for the everyday clothes of the orchestras musicians you couldnt tell this was the dress rehearsal. Though all this shouldve been said about the soloists, other than Israeli Hila Baggio who played Lucia these elements were the most impressive in this production. The cast includes mostly men in this opera, which made it even more evident when some of them werent as amazing as expected. While Italian tenor Salvatore Cordella who played Edgardo was brilliant in each of his scenes with presenting both his vocal and acting large ranges and doing so with a strong voice, others failed to do the same in either one or all of these factors among others. Whether it was Israeli tenor Joseph Aridan who played Arturo as both his singing was hardly heard and his acting was at times confusing, or Russian bass-baritone Vladimir Braun who even though his singing was clear and fluent seemed both distant and heavy in his portrayal of the pastor, Raimondo. Reprising their roles from the 2012 production, both Israeli tenor Guy Mannheim as Normano and Romanian baritone Ionut Pascu as Enrico were very convincing in their roles but they didnt fully manage to use their voices as it was quite a challenge to hear them, Mannheim more than Pascu, especially when they were backed by the chorus. Pascu also struggled during the faster notes to keep up with the orchestras tempo. Speaking of the incomparable Israeli Opera Chorus, led by chorus master Ethan Schmeisser, other than not seeming full of horror even though following the pastors announcement about Lucia murdering her husband Arturo they inform that they are, their superbly united singing, voice control and surprising acting abilities created an unbelievable experience. With a chorus such as this it could only be fitting to accompany it by the precise, soft and mesmerizing Israel Symphony Orchestra Rishon LeZion, conducted by Daniele Callegari. Other than Lucia, the female soloists also included Israeli mezzo-soprano Anat Czarny as Alisa who given her noticeable abilities deserved better directing of her role. Hila Baggio appeared to be very comfortable in the role of Lucia, singing easily and clearly while fearlessly flowing in the required vocal range, as opposed to what could be seen in the productions short preview by Spanish soprano Maria Jose Moreno with whom she shares this role, though this could easily be misjudged due to the videos editing or timing during the rehearsals. In the second scene of part two Baggio was even more in character, precise and tender while she presented an astounding performance of the mad scene. When it comes to the 2012 original set, designed by Enrique Bordolini, costumes, designed by Imme Moller, and lighting, designed by Eduardo Bravo, they complete each other and the opera so well that its most understandable why they were all kept the same as they were five years ago. This is only one example of how masterpieces such as this opera and others, which were written almost 200 years ago, dont require many changes from one production to another in order to remain great, regardless of the time passed.

            'The Israeli Opera will present Lucia di Lammermoor by the Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti, conducted by Daniele Callegari, directed by Emilio Sagi and performed by international and Israeli soloists, The Opera Orchestra - The Israel Symphony Orchestra Rishon LeZion and The Israeli Opera Chorus conducted by Ethan Schmeisser who will also alternate as the operas conductor. Lucia di Lammermoor is the most famous among the many operas written by Donizetti- a composer who succeeded to bring drama to levels of intensity which were unknown before his time. Donizetti (1797-1848) was a Bel Canto (beautiful singing) artist - an opera style that requires superb vocal control and a wide vocal range and flexibility. Among the operas he wrote: Lelisir damore, Anna Bolena, Don Pasquale, La favorite, La fille du regiment and Maria Stuarda. Among other things, the Lucia di Lammermoor opera is known because of the famous aria Regnava nel silenzio, sung by Lucia during the Mad Scene. The aria is 15 minutes long and is the exciting peak of the piece as well as the biggest test of the soloist who plays Lucia. Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor is one of the most Mad, known and performed in the operatic repertoire. Throughout the opera we experience along with Lucia the hardships she is forced to go through and feel empathy towards her when she loses her mind, kills her new husband in their bridal bed and ends her own life. She does all this while singing the most challenging and demanding parts ever written. The Mad Scene aria also entered the film world of the 20th and 21st centuries as an inspiration for artists who combined it in their films soundtracks. Among them: Martin Scorsese in The Departed, Paul Cox in Man of Flowers, and film director Luc Besson who combined the aria in his film The Fifth Element, performed by Albanian soprano Inva Mula. The operas synopsis, with Salvadore Cammaranos libretto, is based on the novel The Bride of Lammermoor, by Sir Walter Scotts, which refers to Scotlands bloody history. This is a story about a feud between two families which leads to the tragic story of Lucia who is forced to cheat on her lover and marry someone else under a threatening pressure by her brother. She kills her husband on their bridal bed, loses her mind and dies. Her lover also joins her grave. The set, designed by Enrique Bordolini, is built as a large hall that its ceiling is made of arcs and walls are made of shining metallic stone along with half sealed half transparent screens which are located next to the arcs in a way that divides the stage to different depth planes. Additionally, color and light games create scenery changes throughout the evening. The Italian conductor Daniele Callegari returns to the Israeli Opera to conduct this production following his previous visits in which he conducted over Un ballo in maschera (2014) and Rigoletto (2012). Callegari was the principal conductor of the Wexford Opera Festival and chief conductor of the Royal Flanders Philharmonic Orchestra of Antwerp. His opera repertoire includes several world premieres such as Alice (Giampaolo Testoni), Oedipe sur la route (Pierre Bartholomée) as well as the operas Turandot, Tosca (Puccini), Rigoletto, Falstaff, Aida (Verdi), Cosi fan tutte (Mozart) and numerous other operas. He has recorded many Verdi operas including La traviata, Il trovatore, Oberto and many other symphonic and opera works. He conducts regularly at La Scala in Milan, the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Vienna Staatsoper and the opera houses of Munich, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Washington, Berlin, Dresden, Barcelona, Tokyo, Zurich, Florence, Venice and many others. He has also conducted the leading orchestras of Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and many others. The Spanish director Sagi Emilio studies philosophy at the University of Oviedo and musicology at the University of London. Between 2001 and 2005 he was the artistic director of the Royal Theatre of Madrid. Today he is the artistic director of the Theatre Arriaga of Bilbao. He directed numerous opera productions, from the Baroque to the contemporary, in leading opera houses around the world including La Scala in Milan, Bologna, Venice, Genova, Lisbon, Paris, Rome, Dusseldorf, Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco, Houston, Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, Vienna Volksoper, Geneva, Monte-Carlo, Nice, Toulouse, Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Tokyo, Arts Festival of Osaka, Hong-Kong Opera Festival, Seville, Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid. At the Israeli Opera he directed Le nozze di Figaro (2015), Lucia di Lammermoor (2012), La Fille du Régiment (2011) and Carmen (2002). A team of Israeli and international singers will perform in this production. In the leading part: Spanish soprano Maria Jose Moreno (this is her first appearance at the Israeli Opera) and Israeli opera soloist Hila Baggio.

            'The works included the remodeling, modernization, and equipping of the entire stage box, as well as the hall and foyers, public restrooms, marquee, dressing rooms, and rehearsal rooms. The building restoration project is part of a comprehensive renewal and relaunch process of the Theater in all aspects of its management. The renovated stage box of the theater features a new system of motorized automated suspension bars, which is the most complete and modern in the country, and complies with the strictest international theatrical use standards. The project also includes a new stage floor, acoustic chamber, and complementary systems with cutting-edge technology, which will be executed in the upcoming stages. Regarding the marquee, hall, and foyers, the goal was to recover the original architectural characteristics of the building inaugurated in 1961: sober, unadorned, with simple lines and shapes and symmetrical structure, using austere materials such as concrete, granite cladding on stairs, Venetian tiles, and wood. The restoration of the Coliseum has been planned in executable stages during recesses, without interrupting the normal functioning of the Theater`s seasons. The enhancement of the building will allow the traditional Teatro Coliseo to stage larger and top-level national and international productions. The works were entrusted to the best architectural firms in Argentina and abroad. Architect ALFIO SAMBATARO, also the author of the works carried out at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, among many others, designed the new stage box, dressing rooms, and rehearsal rooms. Meanwhile, Architect GIUSEPPE CARUSO, author of the Fundación Proa and the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires, was in charge of designing the Marquee, Hall, and Foyers. ABOUT THE TEATRO COLISEO The Teatro Coliseo was born in 1905 as a great equestrian circus. From its beginnings, it established itself as an important reference in the cultural and theatrical life of Argentina, becoming one of the main stages of lyrical opera in Latin America in the 1920s and 1930s. On August 27, 1920, from the terrace of the Theater, Enrique Telémaco Susini made the first radio broadcast in history. In 1940, thanks to the significant donation from Italian Count Felice Lora, the Theater was acquired by the Italian government, which restored and reopened it in 1961. Since 1971, the management of the Teatro Coliseo has been carried out by the Fundación Cultural Coliseum, a non-profit organization whose purpose is to develop and promote artistic and cultural activities. The Honorary President of the Foundation is the Italian Ambassador to Argentina, who appoints the members of the Board of Directors, choosing from among distinguished personalities of the Italian community. Since 2012, the Fundación Cultural Coliseum has been managing an important comprehensive relaunch process of the Theater, both architecturally and in terms of management and content. ABOUT NUOVA HARMONÍA The Teatro Coliseo hosts the production of the Nuova Harmonía Cycle, one of the most important musical seasons in South America, created in 1987 by the Fundación Cultural Coliseum, founded in 1971 by the Italian Government to promote Italian, European, and American culture in Argentina. The Cycle alternately offers orchestras, conductors, soloists, ballets, and actors of international top-level. The period of the Cycle spans from April to mid-November each year. Currently, a total of 10 dates are presented per year, of which about 7/8 are presented at the Teatro Coliseo and 2/3 at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires.',

            'Elisabetta Riva at the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires (Photo Enrico Fantoni). «We were about to leave for Bali when Bino, my then-boyfriend, had a heart attack and cerebral anoxia. He was in a coma for three days, they were already talking about organ donation, but neither I nor his family nor friends gave up. With the support of doctors and daily work, which lasted two years, we helped him recover his faculties. Today he is well». An incredible life lesson that Milanese Elisabetta Riva also treasured much later when she was called to revive the Teatro Coliseo. The second most important theater in Buenos Aires (the first is the Colón), and the only one owned by the Italian state outside our country. «There was an analogy between the two situations: in this case too, an organism (buildings have a soul) was sick and needed rehabilitation. The structure had to be fixed and its identity and memory rebuilt. There wasn`t even an archive documenting its long history, which began in 1905. Last May we reinaugurated it after a total restyling: the facade, hall, foyer, and bathrooms were handled by the Italian architect Giuseppe Caruso, and the dressing rooms and stage machinery – of absolute technological avant-garde – by the Argentine Alfio Sambataro. This office of mine was a storage room full of garbage. But no, there`s no anecdote like the phantom of the opera» jokes Elisabetta, guiding us towards the backstage. The place she prefers: «Maybe because, having been an actress, I like to feel the artist`s adrenaline as they step onto the stage». The audience of the Teatro Coliseo (Photo Enrico Fantoni). So, let`s start from here: how does an actress from Milan end up in Buenos Aires? For love. I studied acting at the Arts Educational School in London, and one of my classmates was an Argentine. He often talked to me about his best friend, Leonardo Kreimer. And he talked to him about me, until – after failed meeting attempts – fate completed its cycle bringing Leo to Milan: he was part of De La Guarda (the innovative Argentine company, ed.), who arrived on tour in 2005. I fell in love first with him and then with Buenos Aires, and I continue to be married to both, respectively for twelve and nine years. And by what twists of fate do you find yourself directing such an important theater, with a program ranging from ballet to classical, from rock to jazz to recitals and even Eckhart Tolle`s conferences? As soon as I moved, I started working as a producer (my other field of specialization). So I came into contact with the Italian Cultural Institute and the Embassy. In 2012, they wanted me in the Fundación Cultural Coliseum: it was necessary to give new life to the theater, which had somehow fallen off the cultural map. Here the competition is fierce: there are up to 500 shows a week between the institutional circuit, the commercial one, and the off. At the end of 2014, the appointment as general director: I take care of everything, from management to programming. And the rebirth began. Thanks to the funding from the city of Buenos Aires (equivalent to almost four million euros), without any Italian contribution. The biggest difficulties you encountered? Planning, in such an unstable economy (inflation can reach 40 percent annually). And reconciling different logics, from macro, political ones (and in this I owe much to the help of the ambassador, Teresa Castaldo) to the personal ones of those who have worked at the Coliseo for a long time. The hall of the Teatro Coliseo (photo Enrico Fantoni). Were they distrustful because you are a woman? Or because you are Italian? A bit of everything. I came out of nowhere, they didn`t know who I was. They had witnessed various attempts at change, none of which had succeeded: sometimes those who approach to renew end up destroying. Instead, I listened, proceeding intuitively (it was my first experience) and sometimes turbulently, using both gentleness and firmness. Does being female help? Generally, we have a more flexible nature… In my case, it was a complication. They called me just when my son Akira was born (yes, the name is inspired by Akira Kurosawa). But it`s not that one gender is worse and one better. In some cases, I prefer to collaborate with men: more concise, pragmatic, linear. The level of detail care of women can be counterproductive. The new stage machinery, technologically advanced (photo Enrico Fantoni). The best is the enemy of the good. Exactly. If we had waited for the right time, for inflation to drop… Every era has its difficulties. No one is omnipotent, but never give up. Our resources are immense and, if we join forces, miracles can be done. Like with the Coliseo. Like with Bino.',

Guest artist Valeria Lima will also participate. The presentation will take place as part of the celebration of the premieres of the technological advancements incorporated by the Solís. In this way, the audience will be able to enjoy not only the new technological incorporations of the Solís but also the music of the great Astor Piazzolla, a genius and innovator of contemporary music. One of the most performed composers in recent times. Piazzolla was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on March 11, 1921, and died in Buenos Aires on July 4, 1992. He was a bandoneonist and composer considered one of the most important and influential musicians of the 20th century. Among his most remembered works are perhaps "Adiós Nonino" or "Balada para un loco." Tickets are on sale at Tickantel for 450 pesos. 160 years of the Solís On September 1, on the occasion of the 160th anniversary of the Solís Theater, a ceremony was held to announce the new technological equipment. In this regard, Martín Blanchet, technical director of the Solís Theater and lighting designer for the show, said that during the last five years, the concern was the "renewal and technical update." "We acted on four neuralgic points of the stage: The black box, the definition of a large projector to avoid renting and reduce the production costs of the National Comedy, Opera, or Philharmonic, making the digital leap and the total renewal of the lighting control of the entire hall," he enumerated. Meanwhile, Enrique Bordolini, set designer, lighting designer, and consultant, said that the aim was to innovate "not only to have the latest technology but also to work in more dignified conditions and with greater safety."',

            'In its Ibero-American premiere, Zimmermann`s opera was staged at the Colón in a masterful production. Human Bestiary. Design by Enrique Bordolini for the grand staging by Pablo Maritano. Photo: Arnaldo Colombaroli. There are authors whose visibility is somewhat out of focus, as if they were born a little too early or too late. In Germany, this was the case with Karl A. Hartmann (1905-1963), for example, an extraordinary composer overshadowed between the second Viennese school and the post-war avant-garde. Bernd Alois Zimmermann (1918-1970) was born ten years before Karlheinz Stockhausen, and that single decade seems like a whole world. For one thing, Zimmermann experienced World War II on the battlefield, and surely some of that experience influenced the composition of Die Soldaten (The Soldiers), the opera that just premiered at the Colón in its Ibero-American debut. However, what Die Soldaten confronts is not war, but human misery in general, and it is difficult to say whether the front-line experience was more decisive than the existence of Berg`s Wozzeck in the gestation of Zimmermann`s opera. Die Soldaten could be considered a continuation of Wozzeck, which is evident, first of all, in the name of the main character, Marie. And here, Zimmermann`s small historical and ideological lag becomes movingly present. While the post-war avant-garde could think of Wozzeck as the last significant document of a dying genre, for Zimmermann, that work was genuinely inspiring, and the operatic genre still had much to offer. In the same period when Stockhausen composed Gruppen, Zimmermann was engrossed in Die Soldaten, which he wrote between 1958 and 1963. Predictably, the opera is based on a twelve-tone series, and it has much in common with the orchestral philosophy of Gruppen: in the spatialization of sound, in the multiplicity of layers, in the abundant percussion, but also in an evolutionary form and a symphonic drama uncommon among post-war serialists. It should be added that on this occasion, conductor Baldur Brönnimann and the Estable Orchestra realized all this with impressive precision and visceral intensity. From an orchestral point of view, it was hard to believe what was being heard on Tuesday in an opera house like the Colón, and what was seen was no less shocking. Supported by an extraordinary set design by Enrique Bordolini, director Pablo Maritano translates the multiplicity of units of place and time presented in Jakob Lenz`s visionary original into a structure of great dramatic and aesthetic significance: a mix of hotel, café, and monoblock, with visible rooms that rotate and unfold into different perspectives: a sordid bestiary, represented with masterful virtuosity. The production is completed with a first-rate cast, led by Susan Elmark (Marie), Julia Riley (Charlotte), Noemí Nadelman (Countess), Tom Randle (Desportes), Leig Melrose (Stolzius), and Santiago Ballerini (The Young Count).

FICHA Die Soldaten Author Bernd Alois Zimmermann Director Baldur Brönnimann Director Pablo Maritano Set and Lighting Design Enrique Bordolini Venue Teatro Colón, Tuesday 12, Gran Abono. Repeats on the 15th, 17th, 19th, and 20th. Rating Excellent. A long preparation The rehearsal period for Die Soldaten spanned from March 21 to July 10. The Colón was able to carry out this rehearsal regime because the previous title, Dido and Aeneas, was handled by a German company, and the local bodies remained focused on Zimmermann`s opera, which requires a gigantic effort. The orchestra readings began in June and totaled eighteen, the first nine conducted by Santiago Santero and the remaining nine by Brönnimann. There were eight preparatory rehearsals for a group of 12 percussionists, led by Diego Ruiz. Mauro Zannoli was called in to design the sound and spatialization of the electronic track. The system comprised 28 speakers distributed around the audience on four levels of the hall, two of them hidden inside the chandelier. One hundred percussion instruments were used, several acquired for the occasion.',

            'The renovation of the Teatro Coliseo involved restoring its original identity while adding cutting-edge technology. The new stage box, hall, foyer, and complementary areas were worked on. The renovation plan included the stage box, hall, foyer, marquee, dressing rooms, rehearsal rooms, and service and technical support areas. The reopening of the Teatro Coliseo marks the beginning of the end of a long history, with the inauguration of the second stage of a mega-project started in 2014, which included the enhancement and re-equipment according to European standards. After these interventions, the new Coliseo not only recovers its original splendor but also becomes one of the theaters with the best technology in the country, on par with European theaters. The renovated facade respects the original lines, with an expansion towards Plaza Libertad through its windows and glass doors. The works were carried out in stages and during theater recesses. According to architect Alfio Sambataro, in charge of the new stage box project, "it was found that it retained the typical construction and equipment characteristics of the early last century, with a mixed structural scheme of metal trusses and wooden beams." The machinery for hanging scenery and its complements was from 1920, which prevented the mounting of contemporary productions. A fundamental part of the renovation was the new mechanical systems for mounting lighting and stage elements. The most significant reform was the stage box, which now has a depth of 11 meters by 19.50 meters wide, with a chapel of 4 by 9 meters. This expansion is complemented by a renewed system of metal grids and bridges with two levels of maneuvering bridges and a third level of technical walkway. The new halls and foyer were designed to recover the architecture of the 1961 building, with austere and stripped-down features. The new structural system of the stage consists of a family of 6 trussed beams. "These beams rest on a system of 6 columns made of laminated profiles 6.50 meters high, which in turn fit on reinforced concrete bases embedded in the load-bearing wall." The old stage box is also being reassembled with a new system of curtains and backdrops, including a new black box composed of five pairs of legs, five borders, and a blackout backdrop with anti-reflective properties. The spaces are very bright, with a strong prominence of the two staircases and glass surfaces. "The original fire curtain," the author points out, "consisted of a 4,000-kilo metal bulkhead, operable by a guided counterbalance system. This system was replaced by a remote control operation." Additionally, a "smoke pocket" system was installed to prevent toxic gases from passing from the stage. One of the new rehearsal rooms, soon to be completed, was named after the famous Italian actor and director Vittorio Gassman. With a project by architect Giuseppe Caruso, the new halls and foyer recover the architecture of the 1961 building, with austere and stripped-down features, without ornamentation, and using sober materials such as concrete, granite cladding on stairs, Venetian tiles, and wood. The new entrance hall is spacious, open, and bright, with an expansion towards the plaza through windows and glass doors, with a strong prominence of the two staircases that frame the space with their silhouettes. The grid motors were imported from Italy. The theater`s advanced technology complies with European standards. "To avoid interrupting the original line of the stairs and not changing their morphology, both the ticket office and the guard room maintained their location underneath them. They were entirely designed in glass, including their furniture." A detail of the renovated restrooms, made new, was the preservation of the old "Adamant" urinals by Twyfords, with their original valves. For the authors of the enhancement, the previous marquee blurred the architectural lines of the facade designed by architect José María Molinari in 1941. "That old structure was replaced by a new one," explains the designer, "gaining functionality and elegance. Finished in stainless steel, it restored the complete view of the facade, where new LED screens were installed to communicate the theater`s programming to the public." The restrooms were made new but preserved the old Adamant urinals. On the other hand, architect Agostina Sambataro designed a new area of dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms to replace a sector that had been successively intervened, without maintenance, damaging its overall functionality. Thus, Agostina`s project consisted of remodeling the dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms from the ground floor to the second floor on the east side of the theater, and the rehearsal rooms on the third floor on both sides, East and West. Once completed, these spaces will be functional, efficient, and compact, optimizing both interior and common spaces. On the ground floor, an independent volume was created, providing a more welcoming scale with lower height. Integrated with the kiosk, the new waiting hall now has twice the surface area, turning what was a passageway into a living area. Regarding the selection of materials, a palette of colors representative of the theater and a contrast of textures were prioritized. The plaster was removed from the wall of the stage box, leaving the original masonry exposed. The other rooms maintain whites, grays, and blacks. For the next recess, the final works will begin: the stage will have a new modular floor, removable by sections. The cover will also be a modular and removable wooden system that, according to the authors, "is a combined design typology that allows openings of different sizes and locations to be left free." The orchestra pit will also be expanded and automated, while the hall will completely renew its seats, air conditioning, and lighting systems. A system of metal panels covered in wood will form a new acoustic chamber. The entire building will be waterproofed. On the second floor, the group dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms remain to be completed.

            'STAGE BOX, DRESSING ROOMS, AND REHEARSAL ROOMS Project: Arch. Alfio Sambataro and Arch. Agostina Sambataro STAGE The stage of the Theater has a depth of 11.00 m and a width of 19.50 m. The house portal is 17.00 m wide and 9.50 m high. It has a chapel of 4.00 m by 9.00 m that connects with the storage area, which is accessed from the outside through two side entrances of 3.50 m wide that connect with Marcelo T. de Alvear street. The grid and bridge system consists of a completely new 65-ton metal structure, which includes two levels of maneuvering bridges, a third level of technical walkway; the lower grid that covers the entire stage surface, and the upper grid that contains the pulley anchoring profile system for the 5 main and auxiliary channels. The height from the stage to the grid is 23.50 m. Above the chapel, there is an auxiliary walkable grid of 3.50 m deep by 9.00 m wide with 7 channels that allow the hanging of lighting systems or decorations. The useful clearance height from the stage floor to the chapel grid is 11.50 m. SUSPENSION SYSTEM Motorized Bars The stage is equipped with 30 motorized automated bars for hanging decorations and lighting with a load capacity of 600 kg for decorations and 900 kg for light bars, variable speed from 0 to 1.00 m/sec, and a travel distance of 22.50 m. All equipment is operated by a computerized system from a main "touch screen" console under the Windows operating system and a portable satellite console that can be connected at various strategic points on the bridges and stage. The bars are made of aluminum trusses, and their fitting system for anchoring the 6mm diameter metal suspension lines allows for the interchange of single bars with 40x40cm trusses as needed. The entire system has a maximum positioning accuracy of 5 mm and can combine or group up to 20 motorized bars and configure various effects with speed changes, positioning, and ascent or descent direction, which can be recorded and executed by pressing a single button. The system allows for future growth, with the possibility of adding not only more motorized bars but also platforms or other auxiliary motorized systems without quantity limits. This entire system complies with the most stringent current safety standards. Motorized Monorail System As a complementary suspension element for both decoration mounting and light bar positions, 2 rails with a trolley system have been installed. Each monorail line has 4 motors with a load capacity of 500 kg, making a total load capacity of 2,000 kg per rail. The control system allows synchronized operation of up to 12 motors simultaneously. The console can be located at various points on the stage and maneuvering bridges, providing great flexibility of use. Auxiliary Manual Suspension System It has a typical manual system for hanging lighter weights at any point on the stage, completely new. Both the pulley blocks and the landing boxes are made of steel housings containing polyamide pulleys with double sealed bearings. This provides smooth and silent movement, low maintenance, and longer life. The ropes used are 12 mm diameter synthetic material with a non-slip coating. The bar system is designed with 50mm diameter external tubular pipes, with 2m modules and safety couplings that allow for different lengths. The anchoring system or cleat for tying the ropes is mobile with the corresponding fitting that facilitates adjusting the manual suspension lines to the activity`s needs. SAFETY CURTAIN SYSTEM The original fire curtain, consisting of a 4,000 kg metal bulkhead, was operated by a guided counterbalance system. It has been modernized. Its new operating system consists of a geared motor with a winding drum that allows it to be raised or lowered as needed using a button control with an emergency stop. A smoke pocket system has been installed, consisting of a perimeter frame with a special seal that prevents toxic gases from passing from the stage to the auditorium in case of fire. It has an emergency release system that delays the passage of flames from one area to another in case of fire. SERVICE AND WORK LIGHTING SYSTEM The entire stage has a new work lighting system from its main panels, ensuring lighting levels on the various work planes of the stage, in accordance with theatrical standards. The control room has been remodeled, and a new dimmer room has been created. The project considers the needs to accommodate various companies and their respective audio, video, and lighting equipment. DRESSING ROOMS AND REHEARSAL ROOMS The operational potential of the floor was restored by eliminating residual spaces, zigzagging corridors, and relocating unused service areas to obtain larger, brighter, and more flexible spaces. Original materials were recovered, expressing them in their natural state, reconditioning, repairing, and restoring authentic finishes and pieces. MARQUEE, FOYERS, AND RESTROOMS Project: Architect Giuseppe Caruso – Studio: Caruso & Torricella Architetti HALL AND FOYERS To restore the original architecture of the building inaugurated in 1961, an austere, stripped-down architecture was proposed, free of ornamentation, using sober materials such as concrete, granite cladding on stairs, Venetian tiles, and wood. The new entrance hall is spacious, open, and bright, with an expansion towards the plaza through windows and glass doors. The two staircases that frame the space with their silhouettes were given strong prominence. All the cladding and layers added to the stairs, walls, and mezzanines were removed, and the hidden architecture was restored. The Venetian tiles that clad the stairs were cleaned and completed, and the original railings were restored, making them safer with the addition of safety glass without changing their appearance. The rubber and carpet cladding on the floors and stairs were removed. Artificial lighting: The original design of the indirect lighting coves was respected. The coves were reconditioned and modernized with low-consumption LED fixtures. New electrical installation. Ticket Office and Guard Room: for functional reasons, their location under the stair landings was maintained. They were entirely made of glass, including the furniture, to avoid interrupting the original line of the stairs and not change their morphology. RESTROOMS They were completely redone, with all pipes, cladding, fixtures, and faucets replaced. They were modernized, more toilets were added, baby changing stations were installed, and two restrooms for people with reduced mobility were added on the ground floor. The original "Adamant" urinals by Twyfords with their original valves were preserved. MARQUEE The previous marquee, obsolete in shape, materials, and functionality, was removed. Its structure obstructed the architectural lines of the building`s facade, designed in 1942 by Arch. José Molinari. The old structure was replaced with a new, more functional and elegant one made of glass and stainless steel, restoring the complete view of the facade and allowing the theater`s various programs and functions to be communicated to the public through LED screens.

            'The work ranged from the stage and its systems to the marquee. "We can offer more plays and more variety," explain the institution. Art is celebrating. Buenos Aires reopens one of its classic theaters, the Coliseo, as "the most modern in the country, after the Colón." This is what the general director of this historic hall, Elisabetta Riva, told Clarín. Everything was done with the support of the Italian Embassy and the Board of Directors of the Cultural Coliseum Foundation – which has managed the theater since 1971 – and the Mecenazgo law, through which the Buenos Aires government contributed $44 million. "We are going to enhance the prestige of the Coliseo – born in 1905 – with more quantity and quality of proposals," Riva said yesterday, after presenting the changes. And she explained: "One of the key works was the renovation of the stage box, which is the heart of the theater." An automated operating system with 30 bars capable of lifting 600 kilos each for decorations, for example, was installed. "This provides a lot of versatility for the proposals," she added. In addition to the renovation, modernization, and equipment of the stage box – also with a new floor, acoustic chamber, and complementary systems with cutting-edge technology – work was done in the hall and foyers to recover the architectural characteristics of the building inaugurated in 1961, "sober, stripped-down, with simple lines and shapes and symmetrical structure, using austere materials such as concrete, granite cladding, Venetian tiles, and wood," added sources from the institution. A "fire curtain" was installed. They also worked on bathrooms for the public, dressing rooms, and rehearsal rooms. And the marquee was changed, "something that will allow us to communicate more effectively with people," added Riva. The director was at the presentation of the works along with the honorary president of the Board of Directors of the Cultural Coliseum Foundation, the Italian ambassador to Argentina, Teresa Castaldo; its president, Cristiano Rattazi; the vice president, Giorgio Alliata Di Montereale, and the architect of the new stage box, Alfio Sambataro, who also worked at the Colón. The Coliseo was not closed during the renovation. The bulk of the remodeling was done during the recesses of the 2014 and 2015 seasons. The Coliseo hosts the production of the Nuova Harmonía Cycle, one of the most important musical seasons in South America, created in 1987 by the Coliseum Foundation. After the changes, expectations are high. The theater, with 1,800 seats, is characterized by offering a wide musical range. Opera, symphonic, folklore. "It has a special acoustics and allows a certain closeness with the audience," said Riva. "Unlike other theaters of similar size, we also have ballet. And now we hope to stage increasingly complex operas." Yesterday, after the projection of videos showing the works, there was a "high-impact show" in the hall. It featured a piano, cello, and violin playing, like gods, suspended in the air. A concert with pieces by Ennio Morricone. Dancers from the Colón. And, in the end, electronics and laser games. The idea is not to leave any genre out of this space. And with such a setup, they made it very clear.',

            'A new cultural center project will be carried out on land adjacent to the existing building to update the cultural offerings in the country. The mayor of Vitacura, Raúl Torrealba, hired Andrés Rodríguez, who was the general director of the Municipal Theater for 34 years, as the general advisor of the Vitacura Cultural Corporation, with the task of "thinking big" for a new stage of expansion of the commune`s cultural activities. This corporation, whose executive director is Hernán Swart, already has eight programs for various audiences and users -Vitaclub, Vitaintegración, Vitamayor, Vitaniños, Vitavecino, Biblioteca, Vitacultura, and Casas de Lo Matta-, all interrelated, but undoubtedly Rodríguez`s main focus will be on the last two. In this regard, "El Mercurio" learned that a new cultural center project will be carried out on land adjacent to the historic Casas de Lo Matta to update the range of the current cultural offerings in the country. For example, exhibition halls with international security and preservation standards will be installed, allowing major world-class exhibitions to come to the country, which are currently prevented from arriving in Chile due to the lack of venues with such conditions. Additionally, the surface area of these lands allows for infrastructure suitable for outdoor mass entertainment seasons in the summer, and even festivals following the Glyndebourne model, and many others from developed countries. There is municipal will, orderly administration, communal resources, and potentially the possibility of attracting significant private patronage. But even beyond the communal scope, the fundamental change under study would be to provide the capital and the country with a new large theater with modern technological equipment and ample capacity, suitable for the most complex opera productions. The Municipal Theater of Santiago is an invaluable jewel, but it has the limitations of a mid-19th-century hall and is no longer sufficient for the national cultural demand. The recent valuable increase in mid-sized halls -a little more or less than 1,000 seats- does not allow for larger audiences with lower-cost tickets. Mayor Raúl Torrealba: "We are working on ambitious projects" Mayor Torrealba, while confirming to "El Mercurio" the hiring of Andrés Rodríguez, assured that the Vitacura Cultural Corporation "has been one of the successful pillars of our management, and we intend for it to continue being so with some ambitious projects we are working on today." One of them, confirmed the authority, is the remodeling of Casas de Lo Matta, with modern infrastructure in new facilities that will allow for high-level exhibitions and theater performances for the community, "accompanied, of course, by underground parking that will clear the surrounding streets." On the other hand, Torrealba said, with the future materialization of a new underground Municipal Theater for Vitacura, we will be the main Music Hall in Chile for more than two thousand people, allowing for operatic performances with the best audiovisual technical standards. "Of course, we will continue to increase and improve the more than 2,500 activities we carry out today through our VITA programs for the whole family." With the implementation of these new cultural contributions, Vitacura and the residents of the eastern sector will be able to count, concluded Torrealba, on spaces of the highest level, without having to move to more distant communes.',

            'The Moneda 759 building, located in the historic conservation area of Santiago, Chile, has a history dating back to 1757 when it was the seat of the Royal University of San Felipe. Over the years, the building has undergone several transformations, finally adopting a neo-Renaissance style in the early 20th century. Over time, it underwent partial modifications until 1987, when it came under the management of the Santiago Municipal Theater, now known as the ballet school. The 2010 earthquake allowed for the creation of a comprehensive restoration project led by Argentine architect Alfio Sambataro. This project aimed to revalue the building`s architecture and maximize the use of interior spaces. Structural studies were conducted to determine the damage and necessary solutions. HISTORY. The architectural recovery included the complete replacement of the glazed roof of the central interior courtyard. Prior to the master plan design, structural damage studies were undertaken, with the corresponding survey and prospecting carried out by private structural engineers and the municipality, which determined the level of damage and the solutions to be implemented. According to Chilean architect Andrés Cumsille, an expert in restoration, "the building responds to a neo-Renaissance style, with a Palladian-style base, which is notably seen in the openings on the second level and their columnar finishes between the arches, as well as some eclectic features from the early 20th century." HISTORY. In addition to the recovery of the facades, the building was reinforced with new metal structures. In addition to repairing structural damage and heritage recovery, new rooms and dressing rooms were designed for the ballet, as well as the professional choir rooms were refurbished, and new administrative offices were set up. "Architecturally valuable spaces, such as the facades, the glazed roof of the central interior courtyard, and the entrance hall, were specially treated to recover their original value and design. False ceilings and stuccoes were also repaired, and wooden doors and windows were replaced," notes the project designer. HISTORY. The project included the repair of false ceilings and stuccoes, and the replacement of wooden doors and windows. The project was completed with the new installation of sanitary, electrical, air conditioning, and fire protection systems. It also included technological upgrades, such as the installation of "spring wood" type sprung floors in the ballet rooms and acoustic conditioning in the choir rooms. The ambiance is completed with entirely new furniture. "As a preventive measure against future earthquakes, the structural repair included a series of reinforcements and new metal structures to work together with the building`s original mixed system, composed of load-bearing masonry, metal, and wood," concludes Sambataro.

            'Gounod`s opera opens the season of the Asociación de Ópera Buenos Aires Lírica with a good, though not excellent, result. Buenos Aires, April 16, 2016 - The Asociación de Ópera Buenos Aires Lírica opened its fourteenth season with Gounod`s Faust. Although the title was already proposed in 2006, this time a completely different cast and a new scenic production were chosen. If in 2006 the result was mixed, this time things worked better without reaching excellence. The opera is condensed from the original five acts into four, with some cuts, the most important of which is the elimination of the entire first scene of the fifth act: La nuit de Walpurgis. Javier Logioia Orbe conducted with meticulous care, but the orchestra did not shine and elevate according to an authentic French style. The mistakes of some instruments, or the lapses in concentration of other musicians - who were texting during the performance - cannot be blamed on the conductor. Darío Schmunck - an Argentine singer with an interesting international career - was a credible Dr. Faust on stage, a confident singer with a beautiful timbre, solid means, and good phrasing. Perfect in the high notes, he just lacked a bit more central depth in the first scene. Soprano Marina Silva was a solid Marguerite, with a good singing line, homogeneity of registers, and notable involvement. Hernán Iturralde, in turn, embodied a perfect Méphistophélès. A magnetic actor, he became the constant focal point of the action. Vocally impeccable, he is always secure in emission and adequate in projection. Ernesto Bauer offered quality and solidity to Valentin, while Cecilia Pastawski was an irreproachable Siebel. Juan Fond`s Wagner was correct, and demonstrating that for valuable singers there are no small roles, Virginia Correa Dupuy made the most of her Marthe. The choir prepared by Juan Casasbellas did its duty, enhanced by an acting commitment that brought it closer to the style of a musical. The talented Pablo Maritano staged this show originally last year at the Teatro El Círculo de Rosario. The action is transposed to France during World War II. A solution so overused that it has become commonplace, uncreative, and ultimately boring. This transposition seems to dull all the religious and philosophical symbolism of the subject which, although Gounod`s librettists favored the love story, is also implied in the opera. The acting characterizations seemed adequate, the choir always very engaged, and if the staging did not offer many insights, it cannot be said that it caused any harm. On the positive side, for example, Méphistophélès` entrance from the audience and the use of a stage from which Faust and the demon observe part of the action should be noted. On the other hand, the worst came in the Church scene, where the Devil does not hide in the darkness but stands in full light, at the center of the stage, in front of an inverted crucifix. It also does not seem credible that Marguerite participates in a black mass celebrated by Méphistophélès in which the Eucharist is offered to a naked woman with the jewelry and hairstyle of the same Marguerite. The costumes by Ramiro Sorrequieta were correct, as was the lighting by Enrique Bordolini. The choir was well prepared by Juan Casasbellas, and the orchestra, although not at its best, did not detract from the overall result. The audience, which filled the Avenida, was enthusiastic, and the applause was warm. By Pablo Bardin',

            'Faust, by Charles Gounod / Buenos Aires Lírica / Musical direction: Javier Logioia Orbe / Stage direction: Pablo Maritano / Costume design: Ramiro Sorrequieta / Lighting design: Enrique Bordolini / Choir direction: Juan Casasbellas / Cast: Darío Schmunck, Hernán Iturralde, Marina Silva, Ernesto Bauer, Cecilia Pastawski, Juan Font, Virginia Correa Dupuy / At the Teatro Avenida / Our opinion: very good. Any version of Faust runs the risk of accentuating the loss that already exists between Goethe`s original and Charles Gounod`s opera; that is, the absence of all metaphysical depth and its reduction to purely sentimental drama. That double background is, in any case, the double background of modernity, and if something underlines Pablo Maritano`s staging, it is that nuance of the character of Faust as the modern myth par excellence. Without unjustified excesses, Maritano`s exceptional staging does not force anything that is not already between the lines in Michel Carré and Jules Barbier`s libretto, but neither does it bring anything from outside. By moving the action to the 20th century - a stylized 20th century without overemphasis - it only brings out that background of the myth that is based on the greed for progress (Faustian pretension of knowing more, wanting more) and the crisis that derives from his alliance with evil. That is where Maritano succeeds once again. But the only merit of this Faust with which Buenos Aires Lírica opened its 2016 season was not the stage direction. The musical side accompanied it. First of all, the voices. The three main characters (Faust, Méphistophélès, and Marguerite) are not easy at all, and this is not only due to the technical demands of these roles but also because each of them presents angles and intricacies. From lesser to greater, Darío Schmunck is an irreproachable Faust, vocally solid and who traverses the entire arc from unscrupulousness to guilt. Marguerite is above all a figure that breaks dramatically, and Marina Silva manages to capture that rupture already in the aria Un bouquet!? O Dieu! que de bijoux! In a way, it could be said that the entire tragedy precipitates at that point. A special mention goes to Hernán Iturralde. His Méphistophélès is truly anthological, with a tremendous irony that cuts the air in two and provokes that nervous laughter that comes from terror and makes Estanislao del Campo`s verse believable: "Just thinking about it scares me." Ernesto Bauer also shines with his emotionally and vocally solid Valentin; Cecilia Pastawski as Siebel and Virginia Correa Dupuy, with a Marthe Schwerlein almost like a criollo farce. The choir under Juan Casasbellas also performed well. The musical direction of Javier Logioia Orbe was attentive to all details and, apart from achieving a consistent performance from each section of the orchestra, illuminated the somewhat external but also intimate nature of Gounod`s invention.

            "The season has begun at the grand public hall of La Plata, in a year that will be marked by the start of major infrastructure works. Martín Bauer is a significant figure on the cultural management map. He has demonstrated this at the CETC, Colón Contemporáneo, Tacec, and the Contemporary Music Cycle of the Teatro San Martín. With political changes in the province of Buenos Aires, the Institute of Culture appointed him as the general and artistic director of the Teatro Argentino de La Plata. The program that began yesterday intersperses names like Zubin Mehta, Peter Rundel, Cristian Drut, Ana María Stekelman, Ensamble Modern, Cuarteto Arditti, Paula Almerares, and Rubén Szuchmacher, among others, alongside titles like Giselle, De materie, Don Quixote, and Cosi fan tutte. 'My experience with the Colón Contemporáneo cycle is that, fortunately, there is no material that doesn't have its audience. What we have to do is find it,' he says, as if that were his North Star for that large, brutalist architecture ship with 900 employees on board. Bauer already knows the Argentino. During the direction of Leandro Iglesias and Marcelo Lombardero (2009/2014), he created and programmed Tacec, its experimentation center, where proposals from Beatriz Catani, Rafael Spregelburd, Romina Paula, and Margarita Fernández will be presented this year, and where, strikingly, there will be no choreographic work. Although at the close of this edition the Teatro Argentino's website says nothing about it, the 2016 season opened yesterday and will continue tomorrow with a free performance of the oratorio Elijah, Op. 70, by Felix Mendelssohn, performed by the Orchestra and Choir under the direction of Carlos Vieu and Hernán Sánchez Arteaga. It will culminate in October, when the theater closes to begin an infrastructure project announced in recent days that will involve an investment of 490 million pesos and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. 'The delay in announcing the programming was due to the development of that infrastructure plan,' Bauer clarifies in dialogue with LA NACION. 'During the summer, Enrique Bordolini, a specialist whom we are a luxury to have as the hall's technical director, prepared a report on the state of the stage. The truth is that as it is now, it is a limitation for anyone; for that reason, it will be a fundamental part of the work that will begin in October. We must bear in mind that, in the last 15 years, nothing has been done to the Argentino. Fortunately, the current government decided to invest a significant amount of money to recover it. We will carry out the work in a way that does not impede the theater's activity. -It seems to be the opposite of what is happening at the Teatro San Martín, where the current management decided to close the theater to finish the work. -I don't know if it's the opposite, I would say it's different. If you don't pay attention to the experience you had, you're a fool. At the San Martín, there was a strategy that evidently didn't work. This case is different because the work to be undertaken directly affects the stage and the facade. This means that the stable bodies can continue working and will force us to present the program in other spaces, such as the Parque Centenario auditorium, the Usina del Arte, or the Coliseo Podestá in La Plata. -The last work of this type that was done in the Argentino building was to install a controversial perimeter fence... -Which I wouldn't have done, but which I'm not going to remove because they just installed it. It had its logic, but it responds to a logic that I don't share. Martín Bauer was part of the remembered management of the Argentino by Iglesias and Lombardero. During part of that period, the Colón was closed for infrastructure work, precisely the ones that will begin this year at the Argentino. Then Gabriel Senanes took over, which lasted less than two months, until Jorge Telerman, former number one of provincial Culture, appointed Valeria Ambrosio. -What did you rescue from the previous managements to project yours? -It should be remembered that with Iglesias and Lombardero we had left the direction of the Colón in December 2007 due to a political change in the city and the arrival of Mauricio Macri as head of government. Those who arrived at the Colón [referring to the direction of Martín Boschet and Horacio Sanguinetti] were horribly wrong and we, as a consolidated team, moved to the Argentino. We overcame the situation quite well until a brutal underfunding problem came along that made us capsize. In hindsight, I wouldn't repeat that experience. What changes now is that there is a more organic direction with the plans of the Secretariat of Culture and the government. To me, the political issue matters, but relatively. At this moment, that coordination with the province is good for the theater. In this tour, I also had a meeting with Valeria Ambrosio that was very interesting and helped me to put together a more comprehensive picture. She tried to do something that didn't work for her: to bring in directors with experience in musical theater, but she did it with a non-crazy intention. Since La Bohème, directed by Ricky Pashkus, was left unreleased from that program, that opera will open this year's lyrical season. In all fairness, I find a much more orderly theater and I imagine it offering shows that stimulate the audience. -Years ago, you created Tacec. Ambrosio closed it because she considered that the safety conditions were not met, but now it returns to the same place. -I'm not an expert, but I don't think we are violating any regulations. If necessary, we will take the corresponding precautions. I defend that space located under the main stage because it already has a history and a special atmosphere; there is no similar place in Buenos Aires. -What budget do you have? -It's enough for what's programmed. It doubles last year's and will allow us to pay the outstanding artistic contracts, which are many. And I want to say one thing without it being a reproach to anyone: owing an artist is immoral. I'm not going to do it, that's for sure. We're not going to do anything that can't be paid, I assure you. It seems like an aberration not to pay an artist. It doesn't matter who incurred the debt. If you can't pay, leave. -You are in charge of the Teatro Argentino, the Colón Contemporáneo, the Contemporary Music Cycle of the Teatro San Martín, and the Teatro Caminito. Isn't that too much? -I will continue only with the Argentino and with the Colón Contemporáneo. The season of the great production theater of the province of Buenos Aires begins its march. As happened to the Colón, as happens to the San Martín, a march whose course will also be guided by architects, engineers, and construction workers.

            "La Plata.- 'If it weren't a public building, it wouldn't be authorized. It does not comply with international safety standards.' This is how the Buenos Aires Secretary of Culture, Alejandro Damián Gómez, summarized the state of the Teatro Argentino in this city. He then announced that 490 million pesos will be invested to restore the building starting in October. In an interview with LA NACION during a tour of the theater, the official said that he visited it during the transition with the previous government. 'The feeling I was left with was one of sadness. I found many things held together with wire. But in addition to the state of the building, there were few people working and very few programmed nights; they were trying to reach 60 per year. Very few. At the Colón, there are 250,' he described. Later, he met with Governor María Eugenia Vidal and told her about the impression the theater had made on him. 'She expressed that culture is one of the priorities of the administration,' Gómez continued, 'and decided to start the works this year. The objectives are the building's reformulation, artistic excellence, and, related to the above, working together with the Colón. Today, if we wanted to program a work by Bob Wilson, we couldn't because the technical conditions are not met. Not only will we start the works at the Teatro Argentino this year. 100 million pesos will also be invested in the total restoration of the Teatro del Lago, so beloved by the people of La Plata.' The new Teatro Argentino building was reopened on October 13, 1999. The previous construction, from 1890, had burned down in 1977. The Minister of Infrastructure and Public Services of Buenos Aires, Edgardo Cenzón, explained to LA NACION that the new building 'was never finished.' And he clarified that the works now announced—which will begin in October to alter the programming as little as possible—do not contemplate the completion of the original project. 'It's about a restoration, about refurbishing what's there,' he said. In 2007, the theater served as the stage for the launch of Cristina Kirchner's first presidential candidacy. Cenzón specified that there will be four tenders. The first, to finish the four turrets. Each one, 50 meters high, has a pressurized staircase and two elevators; the objective is for them to be used as emergency exits. This tender also includes the repair of the fire detection system. 'This part of the work will take 18 months,' said the Minister of Infrastructure. The second objective of the restoration—he added—is the waterproofing of the roof and terraces, which will take a year. '70% of the theater has leaks,' said the president of the Cultural Institute. The architect Alfio Sambataro, the theater's stage technology advisor, said that the fourth basement, 'where the painting and carpentry workshops are, where the set designs are built, is flooded. Now we have to raise the floor with platforms and work on top to avoid getting wet. It's been 16 years of deterioration.' These works will seal the leaks to prevent water from entering from both the rains and the water table. 'The third tender will work on the facade and the squares that surround the building,' said Cenzón. And he added that the exposed concrete facade will be treated with a steam cleaning and anti-graffiti paint system. This tune-up will be completed with a lighting and landscaping system. Finally, the minister added, the stage machinery will be repaired and renewed. It is a system of mobile platforms and hoists that connect the workshops with the main stage, which should have allowed the theater to offer works with complex assemblies. However, according to architect Sambataro, 'almost nothing works. Neither the suspension system nor the floor equipment. The platform design has the richness of offering the possibility, for example, of making stage changes in view.' The advisor added that there are two hoists, on the sides of the chapel, behind the stage, which should be used to lift the set design from the workshops. 'You can barely get one to work. The devices for raising and lowering the sets don't work well either, and they don't comply with current safety standards, such as appropriate load sensors.' The repair of the stage machinery, according to the Minister of Infrastructure, will take about six months. Meanwhile, the theater will continue to function in the current deficient conditions.",

    //         'EL PRIMER COLISEO BONAERENSE, TRAS LOS PASOS DEL COLON Artistas de lujo y un ambicioso plan de puesta a punto marcarán el 2016 Con las intenciones de nivelar el Teatro Argentino con el Colón, el Gobierno de la Provincia de Buenos Aires anunció que destinará 490 millones de pesos para financiar un ambicioso plan de obras tendientes a poner en valor el primer coliseo bonaerense y posicionarlo entre los mejores del mundo. En este sentido, y a un día del inicio de la temporada, se adelantó que Zubin Mehta y Daniel Barenboim enriquecerán la programación artística del 2016. En un alto de los ensayos del Oratorio Elías de Félix Mendelssohn, con el que la Orquesta Estable abrirá oficialmente mañana la temporada artística, el secretario de Cultura bonaerense, Alejandro “Conejo” Gómez, dialogó con EL DIA en la Sala Ginastera sobre el plan de infraestructura cultural que se llevará a cabo en La Plata, que incluye no sólo trabajos en el Argentino sino también en el Anfiteatro del Lago (ver aparte). “La primera sensación que tuve cuando vine durante la transición es la de un teatro triste, apagado, con deficiencias estructurales serias. En esas condiciones, iba a ser muy difícil hacer algo que lo haga brillar y lucir si no lo acompañábamos de un trabajo de ‘maquillaje’ y puesta en valor edilicia”, aseguró Gómez, ex subsecretario de Gestión Cultural porteño. Para su grata sorpresa, la respuesta de María Eugenia Vidal fue “inmediata” y Gómez, que ha estado al frente de elogiadas propuestas como Rock BA y Ciudad Emergente, ya puso fecha: “Este primer año vamos a empezar con las obras”, manifestó. Las obras en referencia son las propias a un edificio que “lleva 17 años sin mantenimiento”, según aseguró el funcionario, mencionando los principales problemas edilicios con los que empleados y espectadores se han acostumbrado a convivir, como las filtraciones de agua en todos los sectores y niveles que, se informó, se extienden al 70% del Teatro. Entre los trabajos prometidos, se anunció la habilitación de todas las torretas (salidas de emergencia) y la puesta en funcionamiento pleno del sistema de detección de incendio (140 millones); se impermeabilizarán cubiertas y terrazas, se completará la carpintería y se habilitarán los puentes (160 millones); se pondrán en valor fachadas y plazas (90 millones); y se modernizará y arreglará la maquinaria de escenario de la Sala Ginastera, ajustes y reparación de cubierta acústica, cambio de alfombra de la sala y el foyer, tapizado de butacas, comunicación inalámbrica. Esta obra incluye también la iluminación del taller de pintura y de la sala de la Orquesta, así como la colocación del piso de rebote del ballet (100 millones). Según se remarcó, la idea es no parar la actividad artística del Argentino por lo que las obras se irán trabajando en paralelo a la programación. De todos modos, se destacó que manejarán temporadas más cortas (abril/octubre), dejando recesos más prolongados en los que se podrá trabajar con mayor comodidad. Se estima que en noviembre comenzarán las primeras obras. PROGRAMACION “Este año tendremos algunos lujos”, dijo Gómez, anticipando el acuerdo con Ciudad de Buenos Aires con el objetivo de “hermanar el Argentino y el Colón”. De estos lazos que recién se siembran ya nacieron frutos: “Vamos a tener a Zubin Mehta y a la Filarmónica de Israel, y vamos a tener el Festival de Música y Reflexión que dirige Barenboim”, aseguró, en relación a la presencia en La Plata de dos de los más grandes conductores del mundo. De la temporada que comienza mañana a las 20.30 (se podrán retirar entradas gratuitas dos horas antes de la función que se repetirá el domingo a las 18.30) serán parte Peter Rundel, el Ensamble Modern, el Cuarteto Arditti, Paula Almerares, Ricky Pashkus y Rubén Szuchmacher. Se ofrecerán obras de compositores como Rimsky Korsakov, Ginastera, Beethoven, Mahler, Tolosa, Stravinsky, Bartok y Bernstein, por nombrar algunos, interpretadas por la Orquesta y Coro estables, bajo la dirección de Carlos Vieu y Hernán Sánchez Arteaga, y directores invitados como Arturo Diemecke (Colón), Christian Baldini y Rubén Dubrovsky. Habrá cuatro títulos de ópera, dos estrenos de carácter nacional: “La Boheme”, “Cosi fan tutte”, “Writen on skin”, con puestas de Ricky Pashkus (cancelada el año pasado), Rubén Szuchmacher y Cristian Drut, respectivamente, y “De materie”, con Peter Rundel en la dirección musical. El Ballet Estable interpretará “Giselle” y “Don Quijote”, y un programa llamado “Tríptico” con puestas de Martín Miranda, Carlos Trunsky y Ana María Stekelman. Por otra parte, el Centro de Experimentación y Creación (TACEC) ofrecerá propuestas de teatro y danza en las que participarán en distintos roles nombres como Margarita Fernández, Rafael Spregelburd, Luis Menacho, Beatriz Catani y Romina Paula, entre otros. Además, se informó que el ballet del Teatro Argentino bailará en el Colón, y el cuerpo de danza del primer coliseo nacional vendrá al Argentino. Un ida y vuelta que se repetirá durante esta gestión. Vale recordar que el Argentino tiene dos directores que vinieron del Colón: Martín Bauer asumió como Director Artístico y Enrique Bordolini encabeza el área Escenotécnica. “Queremos aprovechar este hermanamiento que tenemos con el Colón para potenciar el Argentino, y llegar a ponerlo en su mismo nivel. Si hacemos las obras que tenemos que hacer, si podemos seguir trabajando en una programación de excelenciay generamos una buena corriente de público, este teatro puede estar sin problemas en un nivel similar porque lo más difícil lo tiene: un personal técnico y artístico muy calificado, además de una sala preciosa, y la voluntad de este gobierno de priorizarlo”, concluyó Gómez.',

            "With more than a century of life, the emblematic Teatro Coliseo underwent a renovation to add technology and modernity. What reforms will it undertake to revitalize its architectural heritage? Historic buildings face the challenge of telling their story while looking to the future and considering the current needs of those who inhabit them. With these premises, the renovation of the Teatro Coliseo is being carried out, a symbol of Italian culture in Buenos Aires and the only theater of this nationality located outside its country. The large-scale project is working on the restoration and adaptation of operational units, stage-technical aspects, dressing rooms, and rehearsal rooms to become one of the best-equipped in the city, preserving and deepening its architectural identity. The focus is on improving everything from aesthetics to functional aspects related to technical issues, or those related to safety and adaptation to new regulations. Elisabetta Riva, director of the theater, frames this reform within the comprehensive relaunch project that began in 2012 and also involves the organization and change of authorities of the Coliseum Cultural Foundation, in charge of managing the theater and its activities. She summarizes the spirit of this project: 'We want it to be a new theater, but recovering and revaluing everything that has been done in this more than a century of history. Not only from the architectural point of view, we are also creating an archive of everything that has happened in this time. In turn, we are working to position ourselves as one of the most modern venues in terms of content presentation possibilities, and to be one of the beacons, the cultural reference points of the city.' The director points out that the qualitative and quantitative leap in management and programming required adapting the structures. The first step was to listen to the needs of those who know the life of this building best: initially, producers and artistic directors were asked for feedback on what it meant for them to be at the Teatro Coliseo, both the positive aspects and those to be improved. Their responses and the initial evaluation were the beginning of this architectural project carried out in two stages. The first has already concluded successfully and was made possible thanks to a substantial contribution of 20 million pesos through the Patronage Law, one of the highest amounts granted so far to a project of these characteristics. The selection of the professionals involved was very careful, taking into account the stage-technical aspect, the history of the theater, and its aesthetics in a work that leaves nothing to chance. Architect Alfio Sambataro, author of the works carried out at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, the Teatro Argentino in La Plata, and the Municipal Theater of Santiago de Chile, was in charge of the design of the new stage box, the dressing rooms, and the rehearsal rooms; while architect Giuseppe Carusso, creator of the design of the Proa Foundation and the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires, designed the marquee, the hall, and the foyers. The general coordination was carried out by architect Alejandra Rabuffetti, from the Techint Organization. Among the reforms that have already been carried out in the first phase, between December 2013 and April of this year, are the complete replacement of the stage-technical operating system, the new marquee, and a first stage of embellishment of the hall, foyers, rehearsal room, and dressing rooms. Riva points out that the stage, which she defines as the heart of the theater, was one of the central axes, as well as the modern stage-technical system that, once installed, makes the Coliseo the second best-equipped theater in Buenos Aires after the Teatro Colón. However, she does not overlook the importance of the front part of the theater, the first impression received by those attending the theater. The new marquee, with an LED screen and a glass and steel system, maintains a rationalist style. It is modern, but it is made to enhance the old. That is the greatest value that architect Carusso has in all his interventions: the ability to integrate modern elements with a high level of safety, efficiency, and effectiveness, but organically inserted in the old. The second stage, subject to the amount currently being approved through the Patronage Law, covers from December of this year to March 2016 and includes the completion of the complete renovation project of the hall, foyers, and public bathrooms, the complete renovation project of the dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms, the replacement of the stage floor and the acoustic chambers.",

            "With the stage direction of Prokofiev's 'The Fiery Angel,' the ISAT graduate will become one of the first women to take on that role at the Colón. In her environment. Sanguinetti is a graduate of the Instituto Superior de Arte del Teatro Colón. She arrived at the stage direction. Photo: Gustavo Castaing. 14 years after the last staging of 'The Fiery Angel' at the Colón, Sergei Prokofiev's opera, with a libretto by the composer himself, returns to the theater today; this time with stage direction by Florencia Sanguinetti. The staging will also mark her debut in directing at the premier Argentine coliseum, which will make her one of the few women who, in her own words, has come 'to fulfill the dream to which any stage director dedicated to opera aspires.' Of her 45 years, Sanguinetti has spent 25 working in the theater, from whose Instituto Superior de Arte del Teatro Colón (ISAT), where she graduated as a regisseur. The work of assistant director put her in the challenge of collaborating with very demanding directors. However, she barely remembers three female directors: Olivia Fuchs, who staged 'Pelléas and Mélisande,' Catherina Wagner, remembered for having abandoned her own project of an abbreviated Tetralogy, and the Argentine Valentina Carrasco, resident in Barcelona and best known for her collaboration with La Fura dels Baus, who arrived to resolve what Wagner had left unfinished. But her case is different. 'I grew up in this theater, it's my natural environment. So I recognize that I always expected this moment to come,' she says. How did the environment treat you? Although it's a very competitive environment, I felt a lot of solidarity and generosity from all sectors of the theater. It's a very masculine environment, but fortunately there's no machismo. 'The Fiery Angel' doesn't seem to be an easy title to resolve. It's true. The main difficulty lies in the constant discontinuity of events. But you also have to solve the long scene of the first act, that kind of recitative in which Renata, the protagonist, narrates that the angel of light, who is the demon, appears to her. Everything is narrated in a monologue in which Prokofiev summarized a large part of the novel. Does Prokofiev give any guidance to resolve these dramatic and scenic difficulties? The score doesn't have stage markings, but reading the original book, one realizes that the synthesis he made is very consistent with the essence of the work. What he didn't put wasn't necessary. What is your solution for these difficulties you talk about? I use a generic spatial device, an organic space where the whole opera takes place. The set designer, Enrique Bordolini, and I liked to think of something anatomical that was ambiguous at the same time. How will you use the carousel that you included on stage? It's part of the many elements that will appear throughout the work. I was interested in disconcerting, generating the confusion that appears in the novel, in which temporal relationships are not understood, where scenes are interrupted and everything breaks. This will also be reflected in simultaneous events that have completely different moods. But could you give something resolved in a work of this kind? I've seen versions that try to follow a line, but it seems to me that they take away interest from the work, whose plot is not the important thing. What's interesting is the number of interpretations it triggers. Being a symbolist work, it's surprising to see so many objects on stage, characterized to the smallest detail. Will so much figuration create greater confusion? There are moments in the staging that we have decided to resolve with tremendous realism, although I have a deep rejection of it, as this opera undoubtedly also expresses. The very idea of symbolism is the rejection of realism. And the staging, although it plays with realistic elements, is not at all. However, there are situations that must be resolved explicitly. Why? Because in theatrical language, impact is very important, not only of poetry, but also of staging. The carousel is very useful to me theatrically, because it's an element of Renata's imagination, a memory from when she was little, but it also appears as something sinister. It's a resource that helps me move from one scene to another, to include a certain notion of time. It's an element that will always appear in the background. As assistant director of the production of 'The Elixir of Love,' you were very close to Sergio Renán in his last days. How were those days? I loved Sergio very much. His loss was very painful, not only for me. The entire work team misses him. We had to work with him when he was very ill; he had already had a tracheotomy, and he couldn't speak. But I'm not exaggerating if I tell you that he had a devastating work energy. He had many physical limitations, but his energy was unstoppable. How was the relationship you maintained with him during that period? In that last staging, he confidentially asked me to be his interpreter. It was moving to see him work in those conditions. He disappeared before the premiere. After one of the group rehearsals, Sergio was hospitalized and we never saw him again. It was very hard for everyone to cope with the production in that situation. It's strange; his death was surprising to us. But the panorama you describe doesn't seem to be very encouraging. It was because beyond his illness, we saw him very active; he had resurrected so many times from terrible things, that I think we completely denied what was happening. We convinced ourselves that he would get away with it again. Sergio enjoyed life very much. The day he was honored for the 40th anniversary of 'La Tregua,' we went together to see the restoration, within the framework of the BAFICI. I remember him telling me: 'You don't know, girl, what I would give to be 40 again.' He really felt that he had the energy to start his life again. And when he passed away, I had been commissioned to restage 'The Elixir...' in Montevideo. The whole team went in his name. In the rehearsals, we seemed to see him every time we repeated the things he had indicated here. He was always present. We felt, on the one hand, the joy of having had him, and on the other, the emptiness of knowing that he will no longer be there. The staging will be in its original language. 'The Fiery Angel,' the third inclusion in the field of opera by composer Sergei Prokofiev, born in Ukraine in 1891, is based on the novel by Valery Briussov, an icon of Russian symbolism. In the voice of its protagonist, Renata, the novel narrates the appearance of an angel of light, a demonic figure that first seduces her and then subdues her. In a way, with this work Prokofiev aligns himself with a type of more stark and violent production, in the manner of expressionism. However, throughout its five acts, the piece does not lose its fantastic tone. Although the composer worked on the work between 1919 and 1923 –he corrected it later, between 1926 and 1927--, he had no possibility of seeing its premiere. There were several unfulfilled representation promises. Bruno Walter himself, director of the Berlin State Opera, failed in his effort to premiere it in 1926. Only almost two years after the composer's death, in November 1954, 'The Fiery Angel' was premiered at the La Fenice theater in Venice.

            "The great opera by the Italian musician was staged in a successful production. Great performance by Fabián Veloz as Iago. Teatro Argentino Tumultuous and gloomy. A scene from the first act/Teatro Argentino. Pablo Maritano's stage direction for this new production of Otello at the Argentino in La Plata unfolds within what could be considered an original setting. There are no temporal extrapolations. The staging seeks to explore the grandiose Verdian drama in its own terms. Iago is not so much an intriguer as the authentic protagonist of this opera; nothing could synthesize it more clearly than the last scene of Act III, when the diabolical ensign rises exultant over a defeated Otello who practically crawls on the ground. The set design (Enrique Bordolini) is a semicircular wooden structure, a kind of two-story coliseum, which opens and regroups in different ways, leaving at times in the center of the stage a street theater where some allegories unfold in the background; but also eventually in the foreground, as in the second scene of Act II, in which Iago—in a timely detail of Shakespearean black humor—delivers his Mephistophelean monologue playing with a rubber skull. The scene is at times lively, tumultuous, popular, deliberately strident, although at the same time it is gloomy and dark, ominous, a climate in which the cold light (also by Bordolini) and the costumes (Sofía Di Nunzio) collaborate effectively. The stage production is impeccable in form and content. If Iago is the great protagonist of this theatrical representation, it could also be said that he is in terms of musical performance. He is masterfully personified by the baritone Fabián Veloz, the great figure of a cast that is effectively completed by the Chilean tenor José Azócar as Otello, the local tenors Sergio Spina and Maximiliano Agatiello in the respective roles of Cassio and Rodrigo, and the mezzo Mariana Carnovali as Emilia. The distinguished soprano Paula Almerares was in charge of the role of Desdemona, which may not be ideal for her voice, at least for now. In the first two acts, she seemed a bit overwhelmed by the orchestra and did not express herself with confidence in the high notes, although in the second half her performance improved significantly, with a moving final delivery from her deathbed. Carlos Vieu did a good job at the head of the Estable, although the balance between orchestra, choir, and soloists got a bit out of hand in scenes 7 and 8 of the third act, which are undoubtedly musically very complex. The Estable and Children's choirs had a correct performance. Dedication and Casts The Friday performance was dedicated to the recently deceased Amneris Perusin, soprano from La Plata and active Mother of Plaza de Mayo (her son Daniel Favero disappeared in the last military dictatorship), who had also sung the main female role of this Verdi opera several times. In the present production, the role of Desdemona will alternate between Almerares (today and the 6th), Haydée Dabusti (7th), and Daniela Tabernig (8th), while the role of Otello will alternate between Azócar (today, and the 6th and 8th) and Juan Carlos Vasallo (7th), and the role of Iago, between Veloz (today, 6th, and 8th) and Licio Bruno (7th).

            "Originally built in 1757, the Moneda 759 building, adjacent to the Santiago Municipal Theater, is located in a Historic Preservation area in the commune of Santiago. Taking advantage of the damage caused by the 2010 earthquake, the need for repair was used to revalue its architecture and reformulate its interior distribution to maximize the existing surface area. In addition, the work improved the relationship between the different areas: new rooms and dressing rooms for the Ballet School; recovery and reconditioning of the Professional Choir rooms; new administrative offices; recovery of architecturally important spaces such as the interior courtyard and the main access. More images and plans of the intervention led by architect Alfio Sambataro, after the jump. Description by the architects. The Moneda 759 building, adjacent to the Santiago Municipal Theater, is located in a Historic Preservation area in the commune of Santiago. Its history dates back to 1757, although it has undergone major changes over time. Until 1813, it housed facilities of the Royal University of San Felipe, the year in which the National Institute was founded and occupied its premises. Between 1843 and 1883, the property was occupied by the University of Chile, and then transferred to SONAMI (National Mining Society) and SOFOFA (Industrial Development Society). In 1907, it became the property of the Treasury, which in 1987 ceded it to the Illustrious Municipality of Santiago to be used by the Municipal Theater. The property housed until 2010 the Ballet School, Professional Choir, Center for Documentation of the Performing Arts (DAE), Friends of the Municipal Theater and other complementary functions of the Theater. As it grew over time in terms of activity, the architecture of the old building could not respond correctly to that demand. Over the years, partial interventions were carried out, which, not including a general architectural design plan, meant simple 'patches'. Due to the major damage caused by the earthquake, the need for repair was used to generate a project that reorganized the same areas of use, to achieve maximum use of the existing surface area and improve the interspatial and functional relationships of the various activities that take place daily. The project included the recovery and improvement of the entire building: new rooms and dressing rooms for the students of the Ballet School; recovery and reconditioning of the Professional Choir rooms; new administrative offices; recovery of architecturally important spaces such as the interior courtyard and the main access, etc. All this, along with revaluing its architecture to its appropriate level and the renovation of its service infrastructure: air conditioning, sanitary and electrical installations, etc. Some of the work that was done is: - Structural damage repairs. - Execution of sanitary, electrical, air conditioning and air renewal installations, all new. - Installation of a new fire protection system. - Complete replacement of the central courtyard glass roof. - Repair of false ceilings and stucco. - Installation of Raulí wood floors. - Repair and changes of wooden doors and windows. - Installation of new 'Spring Wood' type rebound floors in ballet rooms. - New acoustic conditioning in Choir rooms. - Replacement of all furniture. - Recovery of the facades. Due to the fire suffered in the Theater in November 2013, the stable Ballet body moved to this building to rehearse in its new rooms, which have the best infrastructure conditions. - It was carried out with the technical supervision of the Municipal Works Directorate through Secplan and the Works Execution Department. - The work was tendered through Public Market. - Amount contributed by the Undersecretariat of Regional Development, Cities Recovery Fund: $1,124,748,000. - Amount contributed by the Ministry of Culture, Heritage Recovery Fund: $125,000,000.

        description1:
            "In his memoir book 'Pretérito imperfecto' (1976), the influential Chilean literary critic, Hernán Díaz Arrieta, alias Alone, wrote that when the relevant people commented on a scenic artwork exhibited in the country, they went to extremes in their judgments: either the piece in question was very bad, or it was excellent and impossible to surpass in its creation. Something of that has happened with the opinions that have been written about the lyrical calendar of the Teatro Municipal de Santiago, in what was already the first half of the season. The phenomenon has been repeated with critical views about 'Otello' by Giuseppe Verdi, whose performances began to draw their curtain last Saturday, and will continue to unfold until Thursday, August 14. The big topic of discussion in this musical year has revolved around the régie, the staging. On this occasion, the direction has fallen to the creativity of the Argentine Pablo Maritano, a young and outstanding choreographer professionally trained in his country. The dramatic idea that the Argentine carried out on this occasion, we could define as classic and conservative, but using those concepts—in the theatrical and operatic field—in the way of their best semantic and etymological sense. Joining forces with those in charge of the set design and lighting (Enrique Bordolini), plus the costume designer (Luca Dall'Alpi), Maritano managed to formulate a coherent show in the best line of what is expected of a title based on the Shakespearean canon. They were not overly elaborate or novel notions. In reality, that wooden cart, with traces of a medieval coliseum, can be seen mounted on any proscenium of a European provincial city that wants to play it safe, avoid criticism from the orthodox, and garner applause from the unconditional fans of Giuseppe Verdi and 'The Bard of Avon'. But even so, Maritano's work has been the most accomplished we have seen in this regard, so far this year, on the boards of the Agustinas street venue. More than for his artistic audacity, for having in his work a clear understanding of the foundations that support an opera régie. In addition, he had the assistance of three great performers. For the American soprano Keri Alkema (Desdemona), the Lithuanian tenor Kristian Benedikt (Otello), and the Azerbaijani baritone Evez Abdulla (Iago) confirmed themselves as actors of a level above the average that we are used to seeing in South American theaters. A couple of details worth mentioning. That transparent curtain, embroidered with stars, which on a night in a port in Cyprus, covers the love that the Moor of Venice and his wife profess to each other, raised the plot intensity of the first act. The disposition of the choir, an essential factor in this title, was well resolved by the régisseur. Placing themselves on the two concave terraces of the circular galleries, their deployment did nothing but highlight their important scenic work, and the dispositions of Verdi and the librettist Arrigo Boito, at that specific point. Of their vocal quality, there is no need to waste words, we already know the height that Jorge Klastornick has given to that stable body of the Municipal: a sound of pleasant and imposing volume. We insist: the resource of the giant wooden installation has been used to satiety for the assembly of this credit—the proof is in countless DVDs, easily accessible on the web—but instead of betting on an absurdly understood minimalism, or on a precariousness in the stage machinery, confusing this with avant-garde scenic abstractions, we are left with the theatrical security proposed by Maritano and his team. After all, it was about honoring the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare, and the costume designer was also precious in that field of action that is his own. Keri Alkema is a singer who travels through an international circuit of superlative vocal demand, and it is very likely that she will soon make the leap to the most prestigious venues in the world. Beautiful, physically graceful, and endowed with a timbre that captivates and challenges sensitivity from beginning to end, she is a diva in the real property of the word. Her sound instrument is beautiful and moves through the musical notes with the skill of an artist who is able to embody mezzo roles and personify roles of a lyric-spinto soprano. Her intervention on stage was the highest peak of the global aesthetic characteristics that we have pointed out in this text. The tenor Kristian Benedikt (Otello) rounded off a good interpretation, regular, quite even, although his, more than in the element of his throat, he expressed it with his acting skills to face a repertoire that, from what is read in his biography, he knows by heart. Similar adjectives could be used to define Evez Abdulla's participation in this production: before a baritone who will leave his voice engraved in our acoustic memory, we saw an Iago with all his perfidious and dramatic evil. The orchestra, well, we already stated it in the subheading of these lines. Antonello Allemandi is a conductor who walks his baton through the musical ensembles of the best theaters in the world: the MET, Covent Garden, the Royal Theater of Madrid, the Liceu of Barcelona. And reading Verdi, for him, must be an experience learned from childhood. At the beginning, the Philharmonic had a little trouble digesting a style different from that of its titular teacher, although later, the experience of the Milanese prevailed, and certain formal discoordinations were forgotten towards the second act.",

            "The company directed by Lidia Segni returns to the Teatro del Libertador. The Ballet brings 'Don Quixote' with the original staging from the Teatro Colón. The Ballet of the Teatro Colón will perform at the Teatro del Libertador on Thursday. This is the third visit of the stable company directed by Lidia Segni. 'We were there other times with Carmen and with a mixed program,' comments Segni in a telephone conversation, shortly after arriving in Rosario. The Ballet of the Teatro Colón presents 'Don Quixote' on a national tour through that city, Córdoba, Mendoza, San Luis, and Santa Fe. One of the particularities of the tour is that the cast travels with the original set design. 'We perform with the same sets as the Teatro Colón production. It's exactly the same. Regarding the adaptation, the work was reduced to two and a half hours,' says the director. The decision is in line with the global trend of staying true to the original but not exceeding that performance time. The delegation has a total of 52 people, with 38 dancers and 14 technicians. 'I have several leading figures. I have chosen two couples for the cities on the tour: Nadia Muzyca and Juan Pablo Ledo play the leading couple in Rosario and Mendoza, while the principal dancers Carla Vincelli and Edgardo Trabalón will do so in the presentations in Córdoba, Mendoza, San Luis, and Santa Fe,' informs the director who was born in Córdoba and was part of the Official Ballet of the Province. 'Don Quixote', Ballet in three acts with choreography by Lidia Segni based on the work by Marius Petipa and music by Leon Minkus, is based on the novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. Petipa's work is loosely based on the episode of the Weddings of Camacho, narrated in chapter 19 of the second part, which tells the romance between the barber Basilio and the young Kitri, Edgardo Trabalón and Carla Vincelli. 'The protagonists shine in the relationship between Kitri and Basilio. Carla brings the mischief and Edgardo, the game of conquest. She is a dancer with more than brilliant technique, and very confident. He is a multifaceted dancer with great ductility for interpretation characters,' comments Segni. The choreographer maintained in this production the passage of Don Quixote's fight with the windmills, a paradigmatic image of literature and ballet. 'I have respected that moment of Quixote's reverie,' says Segni, who has worked on other works in which the body demonstrated growth in dramatic interpretation (as in the case of Manon). The versatility to interpret roles is also attributed to Segni's decision to seek the best choreographers. 'I have brought them and I have the support of the general director of the Teatro Colón,' she says. Regarding the battle with the windmills themselves, the director says: 'I work to achieve more accomplishments with the company. I keep fighting to get the Ballet (of Buenos Aires) out, to travel to Asia, Cuba, Miami. Now it's difficult to leave the country. As for the provinces, not all theaters are equipped and that's why we can't mount the Ballet's shows. We go to cities with theaters like the Libertador. It goes without saying that when I arrive in Córdoba, I'm at home!' Dance for everyone Regarding the presentation of classical dance in a massive program like Showmatch where figures of the stature of Eleonora Cassano or Hernán Piquín compete with people with minimal training, Lidia opines: 'Everyone has to dance and do what they want. I am a person who does not watch television or those programs, because they do not contribute anything to me. But there are great figures dancing, whom I respect. And if the public wants to see dancing at the Teatro Colón or on television, they are within their rights,' she concludes. The other roles of 'Don Quixote' are played by Néstor Asaff (Don Quixote); Marcelo Antelo (Sancho Panza); Maricel De Mitri (Street Woman); Vagram Ambartsoumian (bullfighter); Luciana Barrirero and Macarena Giménez (friends); Igor Gopkalo (Camacho); Julián Galván (father); Igor Gopkalo (Duke); Manuela Rodríguez Echenique (Duchess); Emilia Peredo Aguirre (Cupid). The set design is by Enrique Bordolini; set decoration and costume design by Eduardo Caldirola; and lighting design by Fabricio Ballarati. The love of Kitri and Basilio In the square of a market in Barcelona, the young Kitri is forced by her father, the innkeeper Lorenzo, to get engaged to Camacho, the rich man of the town, but Kitri loves the barber Basilio. Don Quixote arrives in the town and confuses Kitri with his beloved Dulcinea. Don Quixote challenges Camacho for the hand of the beautiful Kitri, but they make fun of him and throw him out of the town. Basilio pretends to commit suicide and asks as his last wish to marry Kitri. Kitri's father agrees, and then Basilio stops pretending and joins Kitri. Don Quixote arrives at a gypsy camp and pays honors to the king of the gypsies. They invite him to the dances and puppet theaters, and Don Quixote, in his madness, confuses them with enemy soldiers and the windmills with hostile giants. Don Quixote rests in a forest to recover from his wounds in the fight with the windmills. He falls asleep and dreams that he is in the garden of his beloved Dulcinea, next to the fairies of the forest. Upon waking, he meets a duke and his court, who invites him to his castle where great parties are prepared in honor of Don Quixote. The Knight of the Silver Moon challenges him and defeats him. It is none other than his great friend Carrasco, who, worried about the knight errant, asks him to leave his wanderings. Don Quixote lays down his arms and returns home. 'Don Quixote'.

            'Renovated and with cutting-edge technology, the Teatro Coliseo opens its doors again, with the aim of becoming an important cultural and artistic center for the region. The restoration and enhancement project of the Coliseo building was made possible thanks to the contribution of 44 million pesos allocated through the Patronage Law, by the government of the City of Buenos Aires. The works included the remodeling, modernization, and equipping of its entire stage box, the hall and foyers, public bathrooms, marquee, dressing rooms, and rehearsal rooms. The new stage box of the theater has an automated motorized bar suspension system, which complies with the strictest international standards for theatrical use. The project also includes a new stage floor, acoustic chamber, and complementary systems with cutting-edge technology, which will be executed in the next stages. Regarding the marquee, hall, and foyers, the aim was to recover the original architectural characteristics of the building inaugurated in 1961: sober, unadorned, devoid of ornamentation, with simple lines and shapes and a symmetrical structure. The enhancement of the building will allow the traditional Teatro Coliseo to stage larger and top-level national and international works. The works were commissioned to architecture studios from Argentina and abroad. The design of the new stage box, the dressing rooms, and the rehearsal rooms was carried out by architect Alfio Sambataro. The design of the marquee, the hall, and the foyers was carried out by architect Giuseppe Caruso. The Teatro Coliseo has the production of the Nuova Harmonía Cycle, an important musical season, created in 1987 by the Foundation. The Coliseum Cultural Foundation, founded in 1971 by the Italian government with the purpose of promoting Italian, European, and American culture in Argentina. The Cycle offers each year, alternately, orchestras, conductors, soloists, ballets, and actors of the highest international level, between the month of April and mid-November.',

            "It is over 100 years old and its stage has hosted classical music and rock. Among the works, they will modernize the stage box and the hall. TEATRO COLISEO. The original front is from 1905 and was designed by architects Carlos Normann and Ernesto Meyer. Some time ago, we announced in this column the recovery works of the Teatro Metropolitan on Corrientes Avenue. Today the good news is that the first stage of the Teatro Coliseo renovation project in front of Plaza Libertad, another cultural landmark of Buenos Aires, has been completed. For some, the Coliseo is synonymous with Les Luthiers because it could almost be said that it was their home, the place where they burst in with their brilliant concerts from time to time. For others, the meeting point with classical music or dance, since the Wagnerian Association operated there and, for 30 years, the Nuova Harmonia cycles. But it also has a lot of rock in its history. In this temple, the national record company Mandioca organized 'Beat Baires' on Sundays in 1969, in which groups such as Almendra, Manal, and Vox Dei burst in. And among so many ribbons, it has the honor of having been the hall where Spinetta's 'Muchacha' was heard for the first time. 'The renovation works attempt to bring the Theater back to its original state and to modernize its stage box and its infrastructures. And to reposition the Theater at the center of the cultural and artistic life of the City,' says Elisabetta Rivas, artistic director of the Coliseo Cultural Foundation, in charge of managing the hall. But when we talk about the original theater, which of the theaters are we referring to? Let's take a bit of history to unravel this building that appears with a front that could be from the first half of the last century, a foyer and a hall with absolutely modern lines and conception... And if we google it, a fantastic facade in the best Beaux Arts style will appear. In a few lines, the story is like this. At the end of the 19th century, a skating rink operated on this site. It was until the American clown Frank Brown convinced a banker to build a circus, given the great importance that the Circo Criollo and theater had at that time in Argentina. They hired architects Carlos Normann and Ernesto Meyer, who built a beautiful hall with a steel and glass roof. And with such acoustics that it quickly became the epicenter of the Opera and Operetta shows that were in vogue in the City. The hall had capacity for 2,000 people plus another 500 standing. In 1937, the Government of Italy bought it with the idea of creating a cultural center for exhibitions and events. Only 33 years after being built, it was partially demolished to make the new headquarters, but the works were paralyzed by the Second World War. In 1942, architect José Molinari was commissioned to install the Italian Consulate offices there. The result is the current front: it had been projected for 9 floors but remained at 5. In 1959, architects Mario Bigongiari, Mauricio Mazzocchi, Luis and Alberto Morea made the new hall. They adopted a strategy similar to that of the Teatro San Martín, at that time under construction. At the San Martín, Mario Roberto Alvarez and Macedonio O. Ruiz placed an office building in front of the theater, which, while solving functional issues, collaborated with the acoustic insulation of the halls. At the Coliseo, the office building was already there: it was the one built in the 40s by Molinari with a certain austere and proto-rationalist air. But inside, they developed a hall with an architecture of pure lines, of a remarkable modernity, spatiality, and elegance. The idea, according to Marta Pires, commercial director of the Coliseo Cultural Foundation, is 'to return to the origins, to the lyrical theater and the classical theater, taking advantage of its extraordinary pits, only comparable to those of the Teatro Colón.' And 'to expand the usefulness of the Theater with a bar and new exhibition areas,' adds Giorgio Alliata, vice president of the Foundation. But the biggest surprises came when specialists began to review the so-called stage box. According to architect Alfio Sambataro, a specialist in theatrical architecture, 'the box was operating at the limit.' He found 'a very elementary structure and technology from the beginning of the last century.' After a tour, it is possible to verify the precarious state of the facilities. The box has three levels: the stage floor, the maneuvering bridges from where the technicians operate, and the suspension grid from where the set decorations hang. The pulley systems are still made of wood and operated with ropes. Now they are working to completely renew all the mechanisms, so that all the bars are motorized with computers and with the highest safety standards. After all, as Sambataro assures, the stage box is the 'heart' of the Theater.",

            'The Clarín-SCA National Competition is held every year, promoted by the Architecture Newspaper (ARQ Clarín), through the Central Society of Architects of the City of Buenos Aires, in which students from all over the country present any of the works carried out in the last two years of their degree. This year, 103 works were presented, of which 3 prizes and 3 mentions were selected. Below we present the First Place that went to the student of the University of Buenos Aires, Agostina Sambataro, who presented her proposal for the new building of the UBA Technical School, in San Fernando. Description of the winner. The project of the Technical School of the University of Buenos Aires is located in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires, in the center of the San Fernando district, within the historic center. It is an area of low building density and both vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Being located one block from the Plaza Mayor, the building is surrounded by a very strong cultural load; however, the train tracks, almost adjacent to the land, delimit a clear socio-economic sectorization denoting a devaluation of the area and loss of centrality. The land has a pre-existence of historical value: the Otamendi Palace. This German Renaissance style building, as well as many other plots in the area, is uninhabited, generating insecurity for residents due to lack of maintenance and public program. The project attempts to respond to these problems by integrating into the tourist-cultural walk, generating public space and neighborhood support programs. The revaluation of the Palace as a historical landmark is a strategic point from which the project starts, generating a public square around it, making it walkable throughout its perimeter and integrating it into the system of green squares. Another decisive factor was the leafy trees that fill the land. The genesis of the building mass arises from the attempt to generate the least environmental impact in the area, avoiding the most important and difficult to transplant tipas. From these premises, the two large voids of the project are located - the first of a public nature, communicating and recognizing the semi-buried level of the existing palace and the second of a private nature, functioning as the central courtyard of the school. In relation to the voids, the two spaces of large lights are located - heavy workshops and multipurpose room - with the possibility of expansion. The spaces of large lights generate green terraces on the upper floor, which serve as an expansion of the school that is developed mostly on the upper floor. The S-shape, with the respective terraces - one corresponding to the basic cycle and the other to the upper cycle - “embraces” the two great landmarks of the land, recognizing the Otamendi palace on one side and the large tipas on the other, circulating around them. Accesses The main access is located on Sarmiento Street - less busy - entering the school through the main facade of the palace and through the central body of the school, distributing in the two wings to the basic and upper cycle. Program The program is divided into common areas, driving area and student area. The common areas are located on the ground floor - library, dining room, art spaces, laboratories - as well as the heavy workshops. Being the most representative space the 600m2 s.u.m., I propose an area open to the neighborhood that works on weekends with cultural and recreational activities of various kinds. This sector is located on Lavalle Street, in relation to the Otamendi Palace. The private sector of the ground floor is located on Belgrano Street, and being raised the ground floor 55cm, generates a visual limit with the sidewalk. The student program is developed on the upper floor, in relation to the terraces, sectorizing on one side the upper cycle and on the other the basic cycle. Within the upper cycle, each bar of the “S” is divided according to its specialty. It consists of classrooms, workshops and laboratories, mostly 50m2. The larger workshops are located at the corners, distributing them in such a way that they are always close to the classrooms. The cores and stairs are strategically located to have a quick connection to the ground floor. The driving area is developed on the last two floors of the Palace, communicating with the school through a transparent bridge. In the Otamendi Palace, a cultural center with art spaces open to the community is proposed on the semi-buried level (-2.00m) and ground floor (+2.00m). Structure The project is developed with a simple reinforced concrete structure, with a square structural module of 6.5m x 6.5m (13m in the spaces of large lights). This gives greater flexibility of use, taking into account the programmatic modification throughout the useful life of the building. At the constructive level, the module also refers to the carpentry, joints and grooves, in a submodule of 1.6m. Materiality The building has an imprint of exposed concrete, saving the application of ceilings. It composes a double skin with prefabricated concrete vertical parasols throughout its upper perimeter that control the east and west sun, generating in turn a kind of backdrop that highlights the palace as the protagonist of the urban space. The rhythm of the parasols increases to the west and east, decreasing towards the other faces. Sustainable development A natural ventilation and lighting system is proposed, both in the classrooms and in the common spaces of the ground floor, generating chimney effects and constant air renewal. The double skin develops a naturally ventilated facade, reducing the greenhouse effect and energy consumption. So do the semi-covered galleries to the north on the ground floor. A green roof system optimizes air conditioning, generating greater thermal inertia, reusing the excavation soil and restoring absorbent surface. It is a compact and austere building, of low environmental impact, which maintains the low scale of the area, optimizing resources and valuing the pre-existences of the place. first place Competition: National Competition “Clarín-SCA for Architecture Students, 2013 Edition” Prize: First Place Work Name: UBA Technical School, in San Fernando Authors: Agostina Sambataro, Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism / University of Buenos Aires, Architectural Project, Explore, Mederico Faivre',

            'The thirteenth edition of the Clarín-SCA National Architecture Student Competition came to an end with the selection of three prizes and four mentions. All the information in ARQ, on Tuesday at the kiosks. FIRST PRIZE. UBA Technical School in San Fernando, by Agostina Sambataro. The thirteenth edition of the Clarín-SCA National Architecture Student Competition came to an end with the selection of three prizes and four mentions. Heterogeneous proposals and the novelty of group participation characterized the competition. The top of the podium was occupied by Agostina Sambataro, from FADU/UBA, for her proposal for the UBA Technical School projected for the historic center of San Fernando. The second prize went to the La Plata duo formed by Guido Prada and Pablo Laszeski (FAU/UNLP), who designed a master plan for urban redevelopment with an epicenter in the El Gato stream, La Plata. A mixed-use building program for Catalinas Sur was the presentation of Tomás Mielnikowicz and María Julia Tavella (FADU/UBA), who won the third prize. The mentions went to Federico Seifer (FADU/UBA), author of a Fairground in Puerto Madryn. Damián Matías Conde (FAUD/UNMdP) from Mar del Plata won another of the mentions for his Judicial City in Concepción del Uruguay. Ekaterina Künzel and Sofía del Mestre (FADU/UBA) were another of the award-winning tandems, for their high-density housing project in Barracas. José Ignacio Airasca and José Luis Ghirardi (FAPD/UNR) from Rosario close the list for their particular social housing project for Santa Marta, a favela in Rio de Janeiro. The first prize went to Agostina Sambataro, who chose the historic center of San Fernando, in the north of the province of Buenos Aires, for the implementation of her project. It is an area of low building density and with a strong cultural load resulting from the pre-existence of the Otamendi Palace, a German Renaissance building now abandoned. The tragic floods in La Plata served as a trigger for the project by Guido Prada and Pablo Laszeski, who designed an urban complex on the El Gato stream, the epicenter of the catastrophe that occurred just over eight months ago in the capital of Buenos Aires. For this work, the duo won the second prize of the Clarín-SCA Competition. Catalinas Sur, one of the most thriving real estate development poles, was the area in which Tomás Agustín Mielnikowicz and María Julia Tavella projected a mixed-use building. The intervention proposed by the winners of the third prize of the Clarín-SCA competition is a tower with public, semi-public and private spaces, on a 37,000 m2 plot. The mentions were: Federico Seifer (FADU/UBA), for his Fairground project in Puerto Madryn; Damián Conde (FAUD/UNMdP), author of the Judicial City project of Concepción del Uruguay; Ekaterina Künzel and Sofía Del Mestre (FADU/UBA), for their high-density housing program for the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Barracas and for José Ignacio Arasca and José Luis Ghirardi (FAPD/UNR), for their urbanization project for a favela in Rio de Janeiro.',

            "These are the rehearsal rooms created in 1960 by the Teatro Municipal and where students between 6 and 18 years old are trained. The Ballet School of the Teatro Municipal has been rehearsing outside its traditional rooms, located on the second floor of the Moneda building with Tenderini, for three years. After the 2010 earthquake, the walls of the two rooms where children between 6 and 18 years old learn to dance suffered serious damage and the raulí floor became uneven. That is why in March of that year they had to move to a warehouse in Recoleta, which offered them space for 200 people. In 2012, the school directed by Patricio Gutiérrez received a better offer: to occupy a couple of rooms in the Gabriela Mistral Cultural Center. However, since the Teatro Municipal received funding from the Undersecretariat of Regional Development (Subdere) for $1 billion to repair the school, the GAM will house the students until the end of this year. 'This building has been operating for many years and its activity has been growing year after year. Due to its age, the architectural response was exceeded and became inefficient. Therefore, recovering the spaces was a pending task,' says the architect in charge of the recovery of the rooms, Alfio Sambataro. The repairs—which began a week ago—will focus on the structure, but also on the secondary installations: air conditioning will be incorporated and the original lamps will be recovered. Apart from that, the facade, which was cracked after the 27 F, will be restored. Carlos Cuadra, the engineer from the company that will carry out the work, Invasco, provides more details of the works: 'It is necessary to do a lot of specific work—of craftsman—on the railings and cornices, which have a unique manufacture.' Not only were the dance rooms affected by the earthquake, but also four other dependencies located inside this neoclassical building: the sheet music archive, the place where the friends of the Teatro Municipal meet, the direction of the Professional Choir and the Crecer Cantando group. These were transferred in 2010—and temporarily—to offices on Tenderini Street. 'None of these venues will remain in the same place as before. The rehearsal rooms and other dependencies will be relocated to improve the functioning of the building,' says the architect. Part of the heritage The building that houses the Santiago Ballet School and that is behind the Teatro Municipal, dates from the late nineteenth century. Before sheltering the little ones who were preparing to be professional dancers, it welcomed Sofofa and the National Mining Society. Only in 1960, the Yugoslav Irena Milovan, who had been the first dancer of the Ballet of Modern Art in Santiago, founded the school. It was the first initiative to provide the Teatro Municipal with a stable classical ballet body. In 1962 the fruits could be seen. That year, members of the school debuted with Coppelia. Later, in 1966, Milovan left the direction and was succeeded by important dance figures, such as Charles Dickson. Also a journalist, Yolanda Montecinos, who was at the head of the place between 1970-1980. This is the first time in 50 years that the building undergoes a renovation of this magnitude, which will last seven months. 'It is a significant project, because it will allow the institution to return to function in its traditional place to educate the future dancers—and choir musicians—who are part of the theater and who are recognized internationally,' says Undersecretary Miguel Flores.",

Fueron parte de los calificativos que Andrés Rodríguez, director general del Teatro Municipal de Santiago y Enrique Bordolini, encargado del área técnica de la misma institución, expresaron tras conocer las dependencias e instalaciones del Teatro Municipal José Bohr de Punta Arenas. Rodríguez y Bordolini, visitaron el recuperado inmueble en compañía de la directora del Consejo Regional de la Cultura y las Artes (CRCA), Paola Vezzani y la encargada del Departamento de Cultura del municipio puntarenense, Maribel Valle. Tras un completo recorrido, que incluyó cada una de las dependencias del recinto que abrirá sus puertas a la comunidad magallánica en junio próximo, las opiniones coincidieron en resaltar que la recuperación del emblemático teatro ha sido sorprendente. “Estoy muy impresionado. Tanto desde el aspecto técnico, infraestructura y detalles. Es una gran obra; extraordinaria. Este teatro está en condiciones de recibir espectáculos de primer nivel”, precisó Rodríguez, quien llegó hasta la capital de Magallanes para iniciar las gestiones que vinculen a ambas salas en la futura puesta en escena de obras y eventos. Para el responsable de los aspectos técnicos del municipal santiaguino, Enrique Bordolini, “es un orgullo ver este edificio. Acá se han cubierto todos los requerimientos; nada ha quedado al descuido. Se han preocupado de cumplir con todas las condiciones específicas y técnicas que necesita un recinto de este tipo”. La directora del CRA, también manifestó su satisfacción al advertir el prolijo trabajo. “Me emociona ver el teatro. Se ha ejecutado una gran obra. Ahora la tarea es presentar en esta tremenda sala obras que estén a su altura”, comentó El recinto de calle Menéndez fue cerrado en febrero del 2009, a causa de las deplorables condiciones en que se encontraba. En diciembre del 2010 comenzaron las obras de recuperación, con un monto asignado de $ 3.360.186.164 aportados por el gobierno regional de Magallanes. El municipio adjudicó las obras a la empresa Bravo e Izquierdo y para la reconstrucción se consideró el diseño del arquitecto regional Carlos Descourvieres, una imitación del Teatro Colón de Buenos Aires.',
