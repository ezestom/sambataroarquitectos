            description1="The building Moneda 759, adjacent to the Municipal Theater of Santiago, is located in a sector of Historical Conservation. Its history dates back to the year 1757, after which it suffered great mutations, finally adopting a marked Neo-Renaissance style towards the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1987 it became dependent on the Municipal Theater of Santiago, functioning mainly as a ballet school until today. The great damage caused by the earthquake of 2010 gave rise to a project to repair and refurbish the building under the responsibility of Arch. Alfio Sambataro."
            description2="The design of the masterplan for the project of recovery, remodeling and programmatic reorganization for the School of Ballet, required previous studies, in charge of engineers who determined the level of structural damage and the solutions to be executed for the patrimonial recovery. As a preventive formula against future earthquakes, a series of reinforcements and new metallic structures were included to work together with the original mixed system of the building, consisting of load-bearing masonry, metal and wood."
            description3="The spaces of architectural value, such as the facades, the glazed roof of the inner central courtyard and the entrance hall, were specially treated in order to recover their value and original design. The ceilings, plasters, wooden doors and windows were also repaired.New rooms and dressing rooms for the ballet were designed, as well as the professional choir rooms which were reconditioned and new administrative offices were installed. The infrastructure of sanitary, electrical and air conditioning installations was renewed. At the same time, technological adaptations were added, such as the installation of sprung floors in the ballet rooms and the acoustic conditioning in the choral rooms. The project included the location of the DAE -center of dissemination of the performing arts- entity that is dedicated to the collection, treatment and public dissemination of valuable historical material of the activity."
